# =============================================================================
# Shared sampling-parameter validators (F-011)
# =============================================================================
#
# Range validators of the form ``not (0 < x <= 2)`` are False for NaN
# because every comparison involving NaN returns False — so NaN slips
# past as "valid" and is then handed to the sampler / Metal kernels.
# Symptoms observed pre-fix on /v1/chat/completions and /v1/completions:
#
#   * ``temperature=NaN`` / ``top_p=NaN`` → HTTP 200 with
#     ``choices[0].message.content=null`` + ``usage=0,0,0``; the Metal
#     backend then aborts the command buffer with a GPU Timeout and the
#     server process dies. Silent burn from the client's POV.
#   * ``presence_penalty=±10`` / ``frequency_penalty=±10`` → HTTP 200
#     with mathematically undefined logit shifts (OpenAI spec caps both
#     at [-2, 2]).
#   * ``presence_penalty=inf`` / ``frequency_penalty=inf`` → HTTP 200,
#     same undefined-logit hazard.
#
# Fix shape: declare the OpenAI-spec range on the field itself (Field
# ge=/le=) so Pydantic emits a 422 for finite out-of-range values, and
# add a single ``field_validator`` that rejects NaN/inf. The
# field-level Field bounds skip NaN (same comparison semantics as the
# legacy in-route guard), so the finite check has to run separately —
# Pydantic v2 invokes both gates per field, and either one failing
# returns 422 with a clear "Input should be a finite number" / "Input
# should be less than or equal to N" message.
#
# Range is OpenAI-spec-faithful:
#   * temperature       : [0, 2]
#   * top_p             : (0, 1]   — 0 disables sampling (illegal)
#   * presence_penalty  : [-2, 2]
#   * frequency_penalty : [-2, 2]
#
# Defined as module-level helpers so both ChatCompletionRequest and
# CompletionRequest share the exact same logic — neither schema can
# drift away from the other.

    ``n == 0`` and ``n == -1`` (HTTP 200 with one choice). Both

    The mutate-then-raise dance matters because Pydantic captures the
    raw ``data`` reference as ``input_value`` on the resulting
    ``ValidationError`` — if NaN remains in the dict the downstream
    ``starlette.JSONResponse`` (which uses ``json.dumps`` with
    ``allow_nan=False`` by default) crashes serializing the error
    body and the client sees a 500 instead of a 422. Replacing the
    bad value with a string sentinel keeps the captured error body
    JSON-safe AND preserves enough context for an operator reading
    the log to see which field was bad. The production
    ``_validation_error_response`` handler strips ``input`` from the
    rendered body anyway (F-094/F-104), but this codepath also has
    to survive a future cleanup that re-enables FastAPI's default
    422 handler — codex round-1 BLOCKING #1.

      * raw JSON token ``NaN`` / ``Infinity`` / ``-Infinity`` (parsed
        by Python's stdlib json decoder, which is non-strict by
        default — every popular OpenAI client SDK plus ``requests``
        emits these on the wire when the caller passes
        ``float('nan')``).
      * String form ``"NaN"`` / ``"Infinity"`` / ``"-Infinity"``
        (clients that defensively pre-stringify floats — the bug
        repro under F-011 uses this form).

    The string form is matched case-insensitively against the JSON
    spec tokens with an optional sign prefix; any other string flows
    through untouched so Pydantic still emits its native
    ``float_parsing`` 422 for ``temperature: "hot"``.

# Optional generation-budget ceiling (M-04 — opt-in)
# =============================================================================
#
# Aanya (round-2 dogfooding) demonstrated that the F-007 body-bytes cap
# does not constrain ``max_tokens``: a small JSON body (e.g. 5K-token
# system prompt + ``max_tokens=10000``) sails through the body-size
# middleware because the wire bytes are well under the 8 MiB cap, yet
# the multi-tenant cost surface is determined by the *generation budget*
# the request claims, not the body size. A request asking for 10K
# output tokens on a model that costs $X/1K tokens is a cost vector
# regardless of how few bytes the request body weighs.
#
# This validator adds an OPT-IN ceiling on ``max_tokens`` so multi-tenant
# operators can cap the per-request generation budget without affecting
# single-machine ("Yuki posture") users who never set the env var.
#
# Contract:
#   * ``RAPID_MLX_MAX_GENERATION_TOKENS`` unset / blank / non-positive
#     → no enforcement. Identical behaviour to pre-fix; the body-bytes
#     cap remains the only generic DoS gate.
#   * ``RAPID_MLX_MAX_GENERATION_TOKENS=N`` with positive int N → reject
#     at parse time when ``max_tokens`` (after the
#     ``max_completion_tokens``/``max_tokens`` normalization on the
#     OpenAI side) exceeds N.
#
# Enforcement is intentionally narrow:
#   * Does NOT add a ``prompt_tokens + max_tokens <= context_window``
#     early-reject. Context window varies per model and that check
#     belongs in the engine (where the tokenizer is loaded). The cap
#     here is purely a *budget ceiling* — a hard policy lever an
#     operator can set without coupling to model state.
#   * Reads the env var at validator time (not module-import time) so
#     a test/operator can flip the ceiling without restarting the
#     process. Cost is one ``os.environ.get`` per request — negligible.

    ``ChatCompletionRequest.response_format`` is declared as
    ``ResponseFormat | dict | None`` so OpenAI-compat clients can send
    the spec-shape directly without our typed model rejecting unknown
    extension keys. The downside is Pydantic's Union coercion picks
    the FIRST arm that parses — so when the typed arm rejects (e.g.
    ``json_schema.schema=42`` because ``ResponseFormatJsonSchema``
    declares ``schema_: dict``), the bare-``dict`` arm silently
    swallows the same payload. That was the F-103 silent-200 hazard:

      * ``{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"x",
         "schema":42}}`` (int) → fell through to the dict arm, then
         ``extract_json_schema_for_guided`` bailed at
         ``if not schema: return None`` (HTTP 200 with no constraint).
      * Same with ``"schema":"hello"`` (string truthy → schema was
         coerced into a string literal in the system prompt;
         downstream JSON parsing produced garbage).

    The route-layer ``_validate_response_format`` helper closes the
    ``type``-enum and ``json_schema``-required arms; this validator
    pins the inner ``json_schema.schema`` shape so the silent-200
    arm becomes a clean 400 at parse time. Kept in models.py (not the
    route helper) so the gate fires before any FastAPI dependency runs
    — the resulting ``ValidationError`` surfaces as a Pydantic 400
    with a structured ``detail`` body the existing
    ``_validation_error_response`` handler already strips of
    ``input``.

        Callers serialize streaming chunks with

        terse (most deltas carry exactly one of ``content`` /
        ``reasoning_content`` / ``tool_calls``). When a generation
        terminates mid-``<think>`` reasoning, the terminal delta carries
        only ``reasoning_content`` plus a ``finish_reason`` on the
        parent choice — and the missing ``content`` key crashes any
        client that does ``chunk.choices[0].delta.content`` on the
