# Our underlying tool parsers all mint OpenAI-style ``call_<hex>`` IDs
# (see the ~20 tool_parsers/*.py call sites that share the
# ``f"call_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"`` shape) — which is the right thing
# for the OpenAI ``/v1/chat/completions`` surface but leaks the
# underlying conversion through the Anthropic ``/v1/messages`` envelope.
#
# Single source of truth: the Anthropic adapter rewrites IDs as they
# cross the boundary. ``to_anthropic_tool_use_id`` preserves the hex
# tail when the input already follows the ``call_<hex>`` shape so
# call-id correlation across logs still works; otherwise it mints a
# fresh ``toolu_<24 hex>`` id matching Anthropic's public examples.
#
# Cross-route consistency: ``/v1/chat/completions`` and ``/v1/responses``
# keep returning ``call_<hex>`` (OpenAI parity). Only the Anthropic
# adapter and route apply this rewrite.
