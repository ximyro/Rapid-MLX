Engine Core for rapid-mlx continuous batching.

- Model loading and management
- Request scheduling via Scheduler
- Async request processing
- Output streaming

The design follows vLLM's engine architecture adapted for MLX.

    Runs once when the executor spawns its single worker. Steps:

    1. Create a new stream on this thread. mlx-lm / mlx-vlm both hold a
       module-level ``generation_stream`` that was created on the import
       thread (the asyncio loop / main thread); operations queued onto
       that stream cannot be ``mx.eval``-ed from this worker thread —
       you get ``RuntimeError: There is no Stream(gpu, N) in current
       thread.`` (#170, follow-on to #161 / #167).
    2. Reassign the module-level ``generation_stream`` in BOTH
       ``mlx_lm.generate`` and ``mlx_vlm.generate`` (Gemma 4 etc. lives
       in the latter, and their ``with mx.stream(generation_stream)``
       blocks otherwise capture the import-thread stream).
    3. ``mx.set_default_stream(stream)`` — anything that allocates an
       ``mx.array`` without an explicit stream context (e.g.
       ``BatchRotatingKVCache.__init__`` doing ``mx.array(left_padding)``
       inside ``BatchGenerator._next()``'s prompt cache merge) also
       lands on a thread-local stream we can eval. ``set_default_stream``
       is process-wide, but the main thread no longer issues MLX work
       after warmup is routed here too (PR #173).
    """
    # mlx-lm 0.31.3+: generation_stream is `mx.new_thread_local_stream` bound
    # to the THREAD that created it. BatchGenerator captures
    # `self._stream = stream or generation_stream` at __init__, and any
    # captured ThreadLocalStream from the import thread fails to eval from
    # this worker (#170: "There is no Stream(gpu, 1) in current thread.").
    #
    # Adopt the worker thread's auto-default stream rather than creating a
    # NEW stream. MLX lazily creates a default stream per-thread on first
    # access — using that stream guarantees ad-hoc `mx.array(...)` calls
    # (which use the default stream when no `with mx.stream(...)` context
    # is active) and our `with mx.stream(stream)` overrides converge on the
    # same stream. Creating a new ThreadLocalStream and reassigning it can
    # leave the worker's TRUE default at a different index, so any path that
    # falls back to the default mid-flight ends up tagging arrays with one
    # stream while BatchGenerator evals against the other.

        # F-012 (RST-mid-SSE zombie KV): a cancellation that lands while
        # we're awaiting the executor leaves the scheduler in a
        # genuinely unknown state — ``run_in_executor`` propagates
        # ``CancelledError`` to the awaiter but does NOT cancel the
        # blocking executor task, so ``scheduler.add_request(request)``
        # may already have run, may be mid-run, or may still be
        # waiting in the executor queue. Without protection the
        # cancellation chain unwinds the route, ``stream_outputs`` is
        # never entered, ``stream_outputs.finally`` never aborts, and
        # the executor-side ``add_request`` completes some
        # milliseconds later — leaving a request in the scheduler with
        # no awaiter. Under a 30-RST storm this happens 0-30 times per
        # storm; the orphaned requests then run to full ``max_tokens``
        # consuming KV cache until Metal OOM kills the process (the
        # upstream cause of F-010 and F-030).

        # cleans up AFTER the executor task actually returns. The
        # earlier ``asyncio.shield`` approach was incorrect — once
        # ``Task.cancel()`` propagates to the asyncio Future wrapper
        # returned by ``run_in_executor``, the wrapper is marked
        # CANCELLED immediately (``done() == True``) while the
        # executor thread continues running ``scheduler.add_request``
        # in the background, so the cleanup could fire BEFORE the
        # request actually landed in the scheduler — exactly the
        # zombie window we are trying to close.

        # ``submit`` returns a ``concurrent.futures.Future`` whose
        # state is independent of asyncio cancellation. We wrap it
        # in ``asyncio.wrap_future`` for the happy-path await, and
        # on cancellation we hand the SCHEDULER-thread cleanup off
