"""User-facing tier dispatcher for ``rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier ...``.

This module is the public surface for the four tier modes:

    rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier smoke    # boot + 1 prompt
    rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier speed    # standardized B=1 perf bench
    rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier harness  # 5 first-class agent harnesses
    rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier all      # smoke → speed → harness

Each invocation boots the model server exactly once (or attaches to an
existing server when ``--base-url`` is provided), runs all tier work
against it, and cleanly shuts it down before returning.

PR #2 of a 4-PR series. PR #3 will rework the ``--submit`` payload to
include all three buckets (speed/harness/agent metrics); PR #4 will
replace ``doctor`` with the env-health-only version. For now, the
existing freeform ``bench`` (no --tier, no --submit) path and the
``--submit`` flow are untouched — both still work exactly as before.
