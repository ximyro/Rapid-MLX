"""Background check for newer ``rapid-mlx`` releases on GitHub.

Surfaces a one-line warning at the top of ``rapid-mlx models``,
``rapid-mlx serve`` and ``rapid-mlx chat`` when the installed version
is at least 2 patch versions behind the latest GitHub release. Designed
to fail completely silently on network / parse / sandbox errors —
staleness warnings should never break the CLI.

Cache: ``~/.cache/rapid-mlx/version_check.json`` with 24h TTL. Network
fetch is opt-out via ``RAPID_MLX_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1`` or any
non-interactive context (``CI=1``, missing TTY).

Behaviour matrix:

  installed = 0.6.14, latest = 0.6.16 (2 patch behind)
    → warns, suggests ``brew upgrade``

  installed = 0.6.16, latest = 0.6.16 (current)
    → silent

  installed = 0.7.0, latest = 0.6.16 (dev ahead)
    → silent (don't nag developers running their own builds)

  no network / cache miss / GitHub 5xx
    → silent (fail-closed)
