    likely to push unified memory past the danger threshold.

    On low-memory Apple Silicon (especially Mac mini M4 24 GB), loading
    a model that forces unified memory past ~85% of total can trip the
    iBoot AMCC async-abort firmware path and **kernel-panic the entire
    machine** rather than raise a userspace OOM. See issue #324.

    This check is best-effort: it warns the user, never aborts. If we
    can't read the model size (offline / gated repo), or psutil isn't
    importable, fall through silently — the existing loader paths still
    surface real failures.

    Working-set estimate is ``model_size * 1.5`` for a typical short
    chat workload — covers KV cache, activations, and OS reserve.
    Long-context (32k+) or high-concurrency serving pushes the
    multiplier higher; the warning under-predicts in those modes
    rather than over-predicts, so a user who configures aggressively
    may still crash. We err on the side of warning earlier than later.

    **Pressure formula uses already-used memory** rather than just
    ``working / total``. The kernel panic fires on absolute unified-
    memory pressure, so a 10 GB model on a 24 GB Mac that already has
    8 GB used by macOS + Chrome lands at projected ``(8 + 15) / 24``
    = 95.8% — kernel-panic territory. The naive formula would have

    """``rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier <T> --submit`` — PR #5 unification.

    Three-phase pipeline:

    1. Run the requested tier's smoke / harness work through the
       existing HTTP-server-backed dispatcher (``run_tier`` with
       ``return_results=True``). For ``tier='all'`` we pass
       ``skip_speed=True`` because phase 2 will produce the comparable
       speed numbers directly from the engine; running the lightweight
       HTTP-speed probe too would just double-cost the bench AND
       produce a second set of non-comparable numbers next to it.
       For ``tier='speed'`` phase 1 is a no-op — straight to phase 2.
    2. Run the locked B=1 ``run_standardized_bench`` against the same
       model so the schema-required ``buckets`` field carries the
       comparable numbers the community-benchmarks corpus expects.
       This phase IS what plain ``--submit`` (no ``--tier``) has
       always done; the tier kwargs just decorate the payload.
    3. Build the schema-v2 payload and run the standard interactive
       submit flow (consent → write → commit → push → gh pr create).

    Tier-failure handling: if phase 1's smoke probe FAILS, abort
    before phase 2 — there's no point benching a model that can't
    answer "what is 2+2?". A phase 1 harness failure does NOT abort:
    submitting a failure row IS the point of the harness tier (the
    aggregator wants visibility into "this combo doesn't pass the
    gauntlet"), so we proceed and let the payload carry the per-
    adapter failure flags.

    """Return True if the trailing ``window`` chars of ``text`` are
    periodic with a cycle length ≤``max_period``.

    Catches the degenerate-model cases the rolling whitespace-token
    counter in ``_stream_chat_response`` misses:

    - ``"BarleyBarleyBarley..."`` (no whitespace separator) — the entire
      suffix collapses to a single ``str.split()`` token whose count
      never increments. Real qwen3.5-4b-4bit regression surfaced in the
      0.6.28 onboarding test.
    - Long-cycle phrase loops, e.g. a ~280-char clause that repeats
      verbatim until ``max_tokens``. Surfaced when asked "describe the
      entire history of the Roman Empire in one long unbroken sentence".

    Implementation: compute the KMP failure function over the trailing
    window. The smallest period of the *entire* window is
    ``len(s) - fail[-1]``; a short period (≤``max_period``) means the
    window is dominated by that repetition starting from offset 0.

    Note: KMP itself does NOT detect periods that begin mid-window
    (rotated patterns). Mid-window degeneracy gets caught because this
    helper is invoked after every streaming chunk — once the model has
    been looping long enough to fill the window, the rolling 600-char
    suffix aligns with the pattern and the smallest-period check fires.
    A pure end-of-stream check would miss rotated cases.

    Cost is ``O(window)`` time and memory per call regardless of
    pattern length (the failure-function array is allocated each
    invocation) — much cheaper than the prior
    ``O(window * pattern_max_len)`` anchored scan, and cheap enough
    to run on every streaming chunk.

    The defaults (window=600, max_period=300) leave room for legitimate
    repetitive content like ``[0, 0, 0, ...]`` lists shorter than the
    window. *Long* lists of truly identical values the user explicitly
    asked for will get cut — a user hitting that false positive can
    ``/reset`` and rephrase. The cost of NOT cutting genuine model
    degeneracy (2000+ tokens of garbage) is far higher.

    #       the early-return).

    #       metadata fetch — otherwise every CI run that sets
    #       RAPID_MLX_AUTO_PULL=1 still pays the network round-trip.
