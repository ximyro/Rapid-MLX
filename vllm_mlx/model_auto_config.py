"""Auto-detect optimal configuration for a model family.

This is the **per-model profile registry**. When users don't specify a
parser, throttle, or optimization flag explicitly, this module infers
the best configuration from the model name/path pattern, with optional
runtime enrichment from the loaded model object.

Two stages:

1. ``detect_model_config(model_path)`` — declarative, name-regex based.
   Runs *before* model load. Returns ``ModelConfig`` with parser
   defaults and capability gates (e.g. whether spec decoding is safe
   for this arch).

2. ``enrich_model_config(cfg, model)`` — runtime probe of the loaded
   model. Used as a safety net for unrecognized hybrid models — if the
   regex misses a new family, the ``ArraysCache`` probe still flags it
   as hybrid and disables spec decoding.

Add a new field here when you have an optimization that's safe for
some arches but not others. Keep regex entries small and ordered: most
specific first.

       known alias name (``qwen3.5-4b-4bit``) or maps to one's HF path
       (``mlx-community/Qwen3.5-4B-MLX-4bit``), return that profile's
       config directly. This guarantees per-alias granularity for any
       optimization that varies by size/quant within a family.
    2. **Regex fallback** (``_MODEL_PATTERNS``) — for non-aliased HF
       paths the user serves directly. Coarser-grained: one pattern
       covers a whole family.

#             string suitable for a startup log: "Model profile:
#             qwen3.5 (hybrid GatedDeltaNet) → throttle ON, spec decode OFF".
#             Always emitted on engine init.
#
#   Level 2 — ``format_profile_table(model_path, cfg)`` returns a
#             multi-line ASCII table. Emitted only when verbose logging is
#             on (server --verbose, or RAPID_MLX_PROFILE=1 env var).
#
#   Level 3 — ``rapid-mlx info <model>`` CLI subcommand wraps
#             ``detect_model_config`` + ``format_profile_table`` so a user
#             can see capabilities without launching a server.

# numbers come from ``scripts/bench_suffix_decoding_integrated.py``;
# thresholds are tuned to match the qualitative recommendation we'd give
# a user looking at the same table by eye:
#
#   - AGENT     — tool calling specifically wins big AND nothing regresses
#                 (we'd tell the user "turn it on").
#   - STRUCTURED — some workload wins meaningfully AND nothing meaningfully
#                  regresses (we'd say "try it for that workload").
#   - NEUTRAL   — within noise across the board (silent — no point
#                 suggesting either direction).
#   - AVOID     — anything regresses past 0.85x, or signal is too mixed
