"""UI-TARS Computer-Use action parser for rapid-mlx.

UI-TARS (ByteDance) is a Qwen2-VL / Qwen2.5-VL based GUI agent VLM that
takes a screenshot + instruction and emits one or more action calls in
the literal ``Action: <verb>(<args>)`` shape. The actions follow the
Anthropic Computer-Use idiom — ``click`` / ``drag`` / ``hotkey`` / ``type``
/ ``scroll`` / ``wait`` / ``finished`` / ``call_user`` plus mobile
variants ``long_press`` / ``open_app`` / ``press_home`` / ``press_back``.

Reference: https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS (``codes/ui_tars/prompt.py``
+ ``codes/ui_tars/action_parser.py``).

Wire format examples this parser is responsible for:

    Thought: Click the search button in the top-right.
    Action: click(point='<point>200 300</point>')

    Thought: Drag the slider from left to right.
    Action: drag(start_point='<point>100 500</point>', end_point='<point>800 500</point>')

    Action: type(content='hello world\\n')

    Action: hotkey(key='ctrl c')

This parser emits each ``Action: <verb>(<kwargs>)`` line as a single
OpenAI ``tool_call`` whose ``function.name`` is ``"computer"`` (mirroring
Anthropic's ``computer`` tool) and ``function.arguments`` is a JSON object
of the canonical shape ``{"action": "<verb>", ...kwargs}``. Coordinate
arguments are normalized from the model's ``'<point>x y</point>'`` string
to a 2-int list ``[x, y]`` — downstream consumers ``json.loads`` the
arguments string and get a structured point, not a UI-TARS-specific
template string.

The accompanying reasoning parser (``vllm_mlx.reasoning.ui_tars_parser``)
splits the leading ``Thought: ...`` (or ``Reflection: ... Action_Summary:
...``) preamble into ``reasoning_content`` so SDK consumers don't see the
chain-of-thought leak into ``content``.

The ``Action:`` lines are stripped out of the residual ``content`` field
so OpenAI/Anthropic SDK consumers don't double-render them as both
``tool_calls`` and prose.

Streaming: emit each completed action eagerly the moment its closing
``)`` arrives. Dedup against the count of actions already emitted on the
previous delta (mirrors the pattern in ``QwenToolParser`` / ``HermesToolParser``).

def request_declares_computer_tool(tools: Any) -> bool:
    """Return True iff ``tools`` declares the Computer-Use ``computer`` tool.

    Dogfood r5-B C-09 root cause: sysprompt injection used to be
    **lane-coupled** — every ``/v1/chat/completions`` request hitting a
    UI-TARS-aliased model got the Computer-Use action-API system prompt
    prepended, even when the request had NO ``tools`` array. The model
    then dutifully emitted ``Action: click(point=...)`` for a "what is
    2+2?" prompt, the parser surfaced a phantom ``computer`` tool_call,
    and ``content`` came back ``null`` (F-R1-L). JSON mode broke the
    same way (F-R1-M: ``content="[]"``).

    The architectural fix is to make injection **tool-coupled**: the
    canonical UI-TARS sysprompt is only injected when the request
    actually declares a Computer-Use tool. Detector input is
    deliberately polymorphic (matches both ``ChatCompletionRequest``
    dict form and Anthropic / Responses-flat lists):

      * ``None`` / empty list → False (caller wants plain prose).
      * A list of pydantic ``ToolDefinition`` objects with
        ``function.name == "computer"`` → True (OpenAI chat shape).
      * A list of dicts ``{"function":{"name":"computer"}}`` → True
        (raw chat-completions tools array).
      * A list of dicts ``{"type":"computer_20251022", ...}`` → True
        (Responses-flat Computer-Use tool; mapped to ``computer`` in
        ``responses_adapter._convert_tools``).
      * A list of Anthropic-flat dicts ``{"name":"computer", ...}``
        (the ``/v1/messages`` tools shape) → True.
      * Anything else → False.

    Why ``"computer"`` specifically: the canonical UI-TARS function
    name (see ``COMPUTER_TOOL_NAME`` above) is the singleton name every
    UI-TARS lane emits. Custom user-supplied function tools named
    something else (``"search_screen"``, ``"summarize"``, …) do NOT
    trigger Computer-Use injection — those are vanilla function tools
    and should round-trip through the model untouched by the action-API
    contract.

    """Auto-prepend the canonical UI-TARS sysprompt to ``messages`` when needed.

    Dogfood r5-B (C-09 / C-10 / C-11 / R-09) root cause: the prior
    contract was **lane-coupled** — every ``/v1/chat/completions``
    request hitting a UI-TARS-aliased model got the Computer-Use
    action-API sysprompt prepended, even when the request had no
    ``tools`` array at all. ``"what is 2+2?"`` came back as a phantom
    click; JSON mode degraded to ``"[]"``; ``/v1/responses`` was the
    mirror image (never injected → never emitted ``computer_call``).

    The architectural fix is **tool-coupled injection**: a single
    decision tree (this helper) reused by all 3 lanes — chat /
    messages / responses — that says "inject only when this UI-TARS
    request actually declares a Computer-Use tool." The signal lives
    in ``tools`` (per :func:`request_declares_computer_tool`), not in
    the route name. Three lanes, one rule::

        should_inject = (
            is_ui_tars_parser(parser)
            and tool_choice != "none"
            and request_declares_computer_tool(tools)
            and not has_ui_tars_system_prompt(messages)
        )

    Operator design choice: auto-injected sysprompt wins; a user-
    supplied ``system`` message is preserved as-is and APPENDED after
    the auto-injected one (additive, not overriding). This matches the
    PR #812 contract that "the alias just works" while leaving the
    operator a knob to extend / constrain the action space.

    Skip conditions (no injection):
    1. ``tool_call_parser != "ui_tars"`` — wrong model family.
    2. ``tool_choice == "none"`` — dogfood C-07 fix: the caller is
       requesting a text-only turn (e.g. for planning / debugging /
       asking the user). Prepending the action-API sysprompt would
       prime the model to emit ``Action: ...`` lines anyway, which
       the parser would then surface as a tool_call — violating
       OpenAI spec for ``tool_choice="none"``. Skipping the inject
       collapses the model into plain prose mode.
    3. ``tools`` does NOT declare a Computer-Use tool (r5-B C-09): the
       request isn't asking for actions — don't prime the model to
       emit them. This is the architectural fix that resolves F-R1-L
       (phantom clicks on "what is 2+2"), F-R1-M (JSON mode returning
       ``"[]"``), and via the same gate firing on ``/v1/responses``,
       F-R2-D / F-R2-I (cross-lane parity).
    4. The user already pasted (a variant of) the canonical
       sysprompt — ``has_ui_tars_system_prompt`` returns True. We
       respect the operator's preferred wording verbatim.

        Used by the streaming postprocessor's fast-path: when ``False``
        the postprocessor short-circuits the delta into ``content``;
        when ``True`` the full streaming path is engaged so the parser
        can buffer / suppress / emit structured ``tool_calls`` instead
        of leaking raw bytes.

        Pre-r6-B contract was "Action: verb( with no balanced )" only.
        The R6-C3 dogfood leak (R2-6) showed that an in-flight delta
        carrying the bare ``Action: <verb>`` token (no ``(`` yet) hit
        the False arm and leaked into ``delta.content`` BEFORE the
        structured ``tool_calls`` arrived. Tightened contract — three
        cases now return True:

        1. The strict ``_ACTION_LINE`` regex (``Action: verb(``) matched
           and has no balanced close — the original case.
        2. The bare ``Action:`` token appears in ``text`` (verb /
           parens not yet emitted) — a few more decode steps will
           complete the action signature, so hold the buffer.
        3. ``text`` ends with a non-empty STRICT prefix of ``Action:``
           (e.g. ``"...thing.\\nAc"``) — the next delta might land the
           rest of the token, so the trailing bytes must NOT be flushed
           through the fast-path; the streaming parser's hold-back
