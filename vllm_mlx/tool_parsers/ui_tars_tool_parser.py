"""UI-TARS Computer-Use action parser for rapid-mlx.

UI-TARS (ByteDance) is a Qwen2-VL / Qwen2.5-VL based GUI agent VLM that
takes a screenshot + instruction and emits one or more action calls in
the literal ``Action: <verb>(<args>)`` shape. The actions follow the
Anthropic Computer-Use idiom — ``click`` / ``drag`` / ``hotkey`` / ``type``
/ ``scroll`` / ``wait`` / ``finished`` / ``call_user`` plus mobile
variants ``long_press`` / ``open_app`` / ``press_home`` / ``press_back``.

Reference: https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS (``codes/ui_tars/prompt.py``
+ ``codes/ui_tars/action_parser.py``).

Wire format examples this parser is responsible for:

    Thought: Click the search button in the top-right.
    Action: click(point='<point>200 300</point>')

    Thought: Drag the slider from left to right.
    Action: drag(start_point='<point>100 500</point>', end_point='<point>800 500</point>')

    Action: type(content='hello world\\n')

    Action: hotkey(key='ctrl c')

This parser emits each ``Action: <verb>(<kwargs>)`` line as a single
OpenAI ``tool_call`` whose ``function.name`` is ``"computer"`` (mirroring
Anthropic's ``computer`` tool) and ``function.arguments`` is a JSON object
of the canonical shape ``{"action": "<verb>", ...kwargs}``. Coordinate
arguments are normalized from the model's ``'<point>x y</point>'`` string
to a 2-int list ``[x, y]`` — downstream consumers ``json.loads`` the
arguments string and get a structured point, not a UI-TARS-specific
template string.

The accompanying reasoning parser (``vllm_mlx.reasoning.ui_tars_parser``)
splits the leading ``Thought: ...`` (or ``Reflection: ... Action_Summary:
...``) preamble into ``reasoning_content`` so SDK consumers don't see the
chain-of-thought leak into ``content``.

The ``Action:`` lines are stripped out of the residual ``content`` field
so OpenAI/Anthropic SDK consumers don't double-render them as both
``tool_calls`` and prose.

Streaming: emit each completed action eagerly the moment its closing
``)`` arrives. Dedup against the count of actions already emitted on the
previous delta (mirrors the pattern in ``QwenToolParser`` / ``HermesToolParser``).

    """Auto-prepend the canonical UI-TARS sysprompt to ``messages`` when needed.

    Dogfood C-05 fix: PR #812 auto-wired the ``ui_tars`` parser to the
    UI-TARS alias family but the chat-completions / messages routes
    never injected the canonical action-API system prompt. The parser
    then silently no-op'd on raw model output because the model never
    saw the ``## Output Format`` / ``## Action Space`` contract it was
    post-trained on. This helper closes the gap: every UI-TARS request
    (parser == ``"ui_tars"``) gets the canonical sysprompt prepended.

    Operator design choice: auto-injected sysprompt wins; a user-
    supplied ``system`` message is preserved as-is and APPENDED after
    the auto-injected one (additive, not overriding). This matches the
    PR #812 contract that "the alias just works" while leaving the
    operator a knob to extend / constrain the action space.

    Skip conditions (no injection):
    1. ``tool_call_parser != "ui_tars"`` — wrong model family.
    2. ``tool_choice == "none"`` — dogfood C-07 fix: the caller is
       requesting a text-only turn (e.g. for planning / debugging /
       asking the user). Prepending the action-API sysprompt would
       prime the model to emit ``Action: ...`` lines anyway, which
       the parser would then surface as a tool_call — violating
       OpenAI spec for ``tool_choice="none"``. Skipping the inject
       collapses the model into plain prose mode.
    3. The user already pasted (a variant of) the canonical
       sysprompt — ``has_ui_tars_system_prompt`` returns True. We
       respect the operator's preferred wording verbatim.
