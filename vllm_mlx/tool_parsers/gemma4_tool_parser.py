# Match the gemma4 tool-call wire form. The model trains on
#   <|tool_call>call:name{...}<tool_call|>
# but those outer markers are special tokens that HuggingFace's
# ``tokenizer.decode(..., skip_special_tokens=True)`` (the default
# the mlx-vlm / mlx-lm streaming detokenizer invokes) silently strips
# at decode time even when we kept them in ``skip_special_token_ids``.
# Empirically (PR #558 share probe 2026-06-11 on DiffusionGemma 4-bit):
#   prompt:  weather in palo alto
#   output:  call:weather{location:<|"|>Palo Alto<|"|>}
# i.e. the model emits id=48/49 for the outer wrappers (gets stripped),
# but emits the inner ``<|"|>`` (id=52) as raw BPE bytes that survive
# the same decode call. So in practice we see only the inner body.
#
# Make the outer wrappers OPTIONAL so the parser recognises both the
# pristine wire form AND the post-decode stripped form. The body
# ``call:NAME{...}`` is itself a learned wire token unique to tool
# calling — Gemma 4 does not emit ``call:NAME{...}`` in natural prose,
# so allowing the wrappers to be absent does not introduce false
# positives on regular chat turns.

# r5-E F-DGF-V080-B-8: prose-fallback recovery patterns. Gemma 4 at
# low temperature (~0.1) intermittently emits prose describing the
# tool intent ("I should call the `add` tool with a=13 and b=29.")
# instead of emitting the structured ``<|tool_call>call:NAME{...}<tool_call|>``
# wire form. Trace verdict (see commit body): NEITHER parser pattern
# miss (the regex above correctly catches every structured emission)
# NOR template tool injection miss (the chat template renders
# ``<|tool>declaration:NAME{...}<tool|>`` verbatim and the model has
# the schema). The model just chose to think-aloud through the
# ``<|channel>thought`` channel without ever transitioning to the
# tool_call channel — pure LLM decoding edge case.
#
# Defence-in-depth: when the structured form misses AND the request
# carried a ``tools`` array, look for the model's tool-intent prose
# and recover the call. The matcher is gated on three conjunctive
# checks (every false alarm we measured was caught by at least one):
#
#   1. The prose mentions a tool name FROM THE REQUEST (verbatim,
#      with optional backticks/quotes). Natural prose almost never
#      names an arbitrary user-supplied identifier exactly.
#   2. The prose contains ``key=value`` (or ``key: value``)
#      assignments for EVERY required parameter on that tool. This
#      is the strong signal — the model lays out the args even
#      when it forgets to wrap them in the channel form.
#   3. The whole prose passage stays inside a single sentence /
#      80-char window of the tool-name mention so a long natural
#      paragraph that happens to contain ``add`` and an unrelated
#      ``a=`` assignment elsewhere is not collaterally captured.
#
# A miss leaves the prose in ``content`` unchanged — there's no
# silent degradation if the recovery doesn't fire.
