"""Diffusion lane — discrete text-diffusion inference engine.

Wraps mlx-vlm 0.6.3's ``stream_diffusion_generate`` so DiffusionGemma
(and any future block-diffusion text model in the same family) can ride
the same ``BaseEngine`` contract as ``BatchedEngine`` does for AR LLMs.

Why a separate engine — not a path inside ``BatchedEngine``
-----------------------------------------------------------
DiffusionGemma denoises a fixed-size canvas (default 256 tokens) for K
steps and emits the whole block at once, then slides the window. This
is incompatible with the auto-regressive scheduler in three ways:

  * No per-token logits stream — emission is block-granular.
  * No KV cache mutation per token — the canvas is overwritten in
    place.
  * Spec-decode + DFlash are silently meaningless (no draft tokens to
    verify when the whole block lands at once).

So we route at the ``modality`` boundary in ``server.load_model``: a
``modality="text-diffusion"`` alias instantiates ``DiffusionEngine``
here instead of ``BatchedEngine``. Everything downstream of the
``_engine`` slot in ``server.py`` is blind to the difference because
``DiffusionEngine`` implements the same ``BaseEngine`` interface.

Dependency
----------
mlx-vlm >= 0.6.3, which contains Blaizzy/mlx-vlm#1347 (Gemma 4 DLM
model files) and #1348 (long-context prefill fix). Verified locally
2026-06-10. The pyproject pin floor is bumped to ``>=0.6.3`` so a
fresh ``pip install rapid-mlx`` lands a build that has the
``mlx_vlm.models.diffusion_gemma`` package on disk.
