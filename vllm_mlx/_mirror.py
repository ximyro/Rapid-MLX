"""R2-first / HuggingFace-fallback model downloader.

``rapid-mlx pull <alias>`` (and the implicit prefetch invoked by
``rapid-mlx serve <alias>`` / ``rapid-mlx chat <alias>`` when the model
isn't cached) tries the project's Cloudflare R2 mirror at
``https://models.rapidmlx.com`` first and falls back to HuggingFace
**per file** on any miss. R2 is edge-cached and substantially faster
than the HF CDN for paths it has; per-file fallback keeps users
unblocked when the mirror is partial (some aliases have ``config.json``
mirrored but weight shards still uploading).

Design constraints (from PR #649 spec):

* Per-file fallback — each file is tried on R2; on any non-2xx (404 in
  practice) we fall back to ``hf_hub_download`` for *that file only*.
  We never abort the whole pull on the first R2 miss.
* Catalog-aware — we hit ``GET /api/models`` once to learn whether the
  alias's HF repo is mirrored. If ``status != "mirrored"``, we skip R2
  entirely. If the catalog fetch fails (network, 5xx), we transparently
  fall through to HF for everything.
* HF-cache-compatible — files land at
  ``~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--<owner>--<repo>/snapshots/<rev>/<file>``
  with ``refs/main`` pinned. The next ``hf_hub_download`` /
  ``snapshot_download`` call sees a cache hit. We do NOT invent a
  parallel cache.
* Default ON — set ``RAPID_MLX_MODEL_MIRROR=""`` to disable.
* No new third-party deps — stdlib ``urllib`` + ``huggingface_hub``.
* Concurrency capped at 4 to stay polite to Cloudflare.
* Resume — interrupted ``.part`` files are completed via ``Range`` requests.
* Integrity — ``Content-Length`` from R2 is compared against the size
  HF advertises. Mismatch → delete the R2 byte stream and fall back.
