    triple-backtick whose payload starts (after an optional ``json``
    language tag and whitespace) with ``{`` or ``[`` — i.e., the
    fence whose body is actual JSON.

    Codex r7 BLOCKING: a preamble may include NON-JSON fenced
    examples (``\\n```python\\nx=1\\n``` ``) before the actual JSON
    fence; the earlier ``buf.find("```")`` anchored on the python

    a fence whose payload begins with a JSON delimiter eliminates
    that ambiguity — language-tagged code blocks (python, bash,
    etc.) and string-content fences don't match.

    Codex r10 BLOCKING: the scan must NOT look past the
    matching CLOSING fence of a NON-JSON block. Otherwise a preamble
    like ``\\n```python\\nx\\n```\\n{"k":1}`` would treat the python
    block's closing ``` ``` `` (followed by ``\\n{`` in the next text)

    matching closer and skip past the closer before scanning the
    next fence — only the OPENING fences can win, and only those
    whose immediately-following payload begins with a JSON delimiter.

    Returns the index of the first backtick of the chosen fence,

        violates the OpenAI spec.

        OpenAI spec: ``tool_calls[i].function.arguments`` is a string
        encoding a JSON object — every declared tool schema is
        ``{"type":"object","properties":{…}}``. A finalized anchor
        whose ``arguments`` is not a JSON-object-encoded string can
        never satisfy the contract, so it is always the model's
        scratch:

          * Bare integer (``"1234567890"``) — valid JSON, non-object.
          * JSON-quoted string (``'"☉ Paris output"'``) — valid JSON,
            non-object.
          * Bare unquoted text (``"☉ Paris output"``) — NOT valid
            JSON at all (codex r2 BLOCKING #1; observed when phi-4-
            mini-reasoning panics inside ``<think>`` and emits prose
            where a JSON body should be).
          * Array root (``"[1,2]"``) — valid JSON, non-object.

        Codex r3 BLOCKING #1: a hypothetical future parser could emit
        a single delta carrying ``name`` PLUS the first PARTIAL JSON
        fragment (``'{"city":"Pa'``). The current rapid-mlx parsers
        don't do this (hermes / qwen3coder finalize args before
        emitting them with ``name``, or emit ``name`` with empty args
        and stream fragments WITHOUT ``name``), but defending against
        it costs only one extra check: when ``json.loads`` raises AND
        the braces are unbalanced (``{`` count > ``}`` count), treat
        the body as a partial fragment in progress and pass it
        through — the cap + tool-call merge will accumulate the rest
        across subsequent deltas. Only when the JSON is well-formed
        AND non-object, OR when it's syntactically broken with
        balanced braces, do we drop the anchor.

        Returns False when ``args_str`` is missing / empty /

           than the forced choice. This catches harmony / gemma4
           channel-routed calls to other tools the model speculated
           on but the client never requested.

        2. **Schema-violating arguments**: an anchor whose

           OBJECT. The OpenAI spec mandates ``arguments`` be a JSON-
           encoded string and tool schemas are object-shaped

        New rule:

          - Capped (parallel=false): for each delta, if its ``index``
            is already admitted, pass through (continuation). If
            ``index`` is absent AND the delta carries ONLY argument
            fragments (no new ``id`` / ``name``), treat it as a

            delta was treated as a continuation, leaking a second
            full call past the cap.
          - Cap-full new calls are dropped, AND their later
