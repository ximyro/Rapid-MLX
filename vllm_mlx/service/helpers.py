    ``/v1/messages`` non-streaming paths so both surfaces extract
    reasoning identically — bypassing this on one route was the
    silent-divergence bug filed as issue #413.

    Rule (drives the unclosed-`<tool_call>` leak fix in PR #208): when
    the tool parser successfully extracted ``tool_calls`` its
    ``cleaned_text`` is authoritative — both ``<think>`` and tool tags
    are already stripped. Run the reasoning parser on the raw output
    only to recover ``reasoning_text``, never to overwrite
    ``cleaned_text`` (that path would re-introduce the tool tags the
    parser stripped, since the reasoning parser only knows about
    ``<think>``).

    When no tool_calls fire, the reasoning parser is the only thing
    that can pull ``<think>`` out — run it on cleaned_text (or raw
    output if cleaning produced an empty string). If the parser
    returns ``(None, None)`` it means the input has no reasoning
    markers it understands — keep the original ``cleaned_text``
    instead of clobbering it with ``None``. This is critical for
    harmony models, where ``clean_output_text`` (called in
    ``engine.generate``) has already extracted the final-channel
    content and stripped channel markup before the parser ever sees
    the text: a ``HarmonyReasoningParser`` searching for
    ``<|channel|>final`` on the already-cleaned string returns
    ``(None, None)`` and without this guard would silently turn a
    fully-formed answer into an empty ``TextBlock`` for clients
    (anthropic_sdk / langchain / pydantic_ai non-streaming
    integrations, v0.6.64 pr_validate baseline).

    The route layer's normal ``content`` extraction can legitimately
    produce an empty ``final_content`` when the model emits ONLY
    reasoning tokens and never closes the reasoning channel into a
    ``content``/``final`` channel or a tool call. The exact production
    failure mode: ``gemma-4-26b-4bit`` multi-turn tool flows where the
    model gets stuck inside ``<|channel>thought\\n...`` and runs out of
    its token budget before emitting any ``<|tool_call>`` or
    ``<|channel>content`` marker. The engine's token-level
    ``OutputRouter`` correctly routes every token to ``reasoning`` —
    but the route then emits an OpenAI-compat message with
    ``content=null`` and ``tool_calls=null`` while
    ``reasoning_content`` carries the entire stuck thought. Agentic
    clients (Cline, Cursor, Codex CLI) read ``content`` and
    ``tool_calls`` only, see an empty message, and either retry into
    the same trap or stall.

    Rescue rule: when ``final_content`` is empty/None AND no
    ``tool_calls`` fired AND ``reasoning_text`` is non-empty, surface
    ``reasoning_text`` as ``content``. ``reasoning_content`` stays
    populated unchanged — duplication between the two fields is the
    lesser evil vs. a silently empty response.

    Cases that fall through unchanged:

    * Happy path: ``final_content`` is non-empty AND has at least one
      non-whitespace char → return as-is. Whitespace-only
      ``final_content`` (``"   \n"``) is treated as semantically
      absent for rescue purposes (codex round-3 NIT on #676): an
      OpenAI-compat client still sees an empty assistant turn, so
      the rescue must be allowed to fire when reasoning is present.
      The strip is on the predicate only — the original
      ``final_content`` propagates back on the happy path so callers
      that DO want the whitespace preserved still see it as-is.
    * Tool-call path: ``tool_calls`` non-empty → the spec already
      requires ``content`` to be ``None`` (the tool call IS the
      response); rescue does NOT fire.
    * Truly empty: ``reasoning_text`` empty OR whitespace-only →
      nothing semantically rescue-worthy; ``None`` propagates. The
      whitespace-only check (codex round-1 NIT on #676) closes a
      gap where ``"   \n"`` would surface as non-empty ``content``
      while still being semantically empty to clients. The
      ORIGINAL ``reasoning_text`` is returned untouched (no
      ``.strip()`` on the assignment) so callers that DO want the
      whitespace preserved still see it as-is — the strip is on
      the predicate only.

    The rescue lives at the route layer (not the engine) because the
    engine's ``_route_tokens_for_channels`` has a tested contract
    (issue #442's harmony fix pins ``content == ""`` when only the
    analysis channel fires) — flipping that at the engine level
    would re-leak analysis text into ``content`` for the original
    #442 case. The rescue runs AFTER tool-call parsing and AFTER the
    reasoning/content split, as a final route-level safety net so
    silent drops never escape to clients regardless of which model
    family produced them.

    Codex round-3 BLOCKING on #676: this helper is now the SINGLE
    predicate for both the non-streaming AND streaming rescue paths
    (chat.py:~1285 and chat.py:~1605). The streaming path used to
    promote ``processor.accumulated_reasoning`` directly into
    ``delta.content`` without the whitespace guard, so a
    reasoning-only stream of ``"   \n"`` would emit a semantically
    empty ``delta.content`` while non-streaming correctly suppressed
    it. Routing both call sites through this helper closes that
    asymmetry — the predicate cannot drift between the two paths
    because there's only one of it.

# A 8 MiB body of plain ASCII is still ~2M tokens — well past any model's
# context window. The body-size middleware ``vllm_mlx/middleware/body_size.py``
# stops the worst of the DoS, but a request that fits inside the byte
# cap can still drag a small-context model into pointless prefill.
#
# These helpers surface the model's max context length and raise a
# structured OpenAI ``context_length_exceeded`` error when a prompt is
# too long, so the rejection lands BEFORE the engine starts prefill.

# Sentinel-large fallback used when the model exposes no useful context
# field. We do NOT silently bypass the gate (returning ``None`` would
# accept any prompt); instead we use a value so large that legitimate
# requests pass while the DoS pattern (≈ millions of tokens in one body)
# still trips. Sized for 8 MiB body cap × ~3.5 chars/token worst-case.

    """Return the model's max prompt-token context window for ``engine``.

    Resolution order (first hit wins):
      1. ``engine._model.args.max_position_embeddings`` — mlx-lm dense
         LLMs and most MLX models expose the HF config there.
      2. ``engine._model.args.text_config.max_position_embeddings`` —
         multimodal Qwen3.5 / Gemma 4 nest the text-config inside.
      3. ``engine._model.config.max_position_embeddings`` — older
         attribute style.
      4. ``engine.tokenizer.model_max_length`` if not the HuggingFace
         "VERY_LARGE_INTEGER" sentinel (``1e30``). Some tokenizers
         report a useful cap here even when the model object doesn't.
      5. ``_FALLBACK_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`` — see module-level comment.

    The function is intentionally permissive about missing fields: we'd
    rather pass through a request the model can handle than refuse a
    legitimate one on metadata absence. The byte cap stays as the
    last-resort DoS gate even if every probe falls through.
