    text parser surfaced no calls (#571).

    Text-parser paths (hermes / qwen3_coder / minimax / glm47 / …) only
    surface a tool_call when the model emits the parser's wire markers.
    Channel-routed paths (harmony / gemma4) bypass the text parser
    entirely — the ``OutputRouter`` extracts structured tool_calls
    directly. The two surfaces therefore diverge on the same request:
    a forced ``tool_choice`` succeeds on harmony because the model
    produced the structured channel, but 422s on hermes when the model
    produced text that the parser failed to recognise.

    The OpenAI ``tool_choice`` contract is parser-agnostic: when the
    client forces a tool call, the response MUST carry one. To restore
    symmetry we synthesise a tool_call server-side when the target tool
    is unambiguous (named-function, or ``"required"`` with a single
    tool). Arguments default to ``"{}"`` because we have no signal
    about what the model intended to pass; downstream
    ``_validate_tool_call_params`` logs a warning when required
    parameters are missing, mirroring the diagnostic surface clients
    already see for model-generated calls with bad arguments. The
    contract guarantee is "a tool_call is present", not "the arguments
    are correct".

# Matches a single backslash directly followed by a non-ASCII codepoint.

# can produce strings like ``"\\빠\\르\\게"`` — valid JSON, but the decoded
# value carries literal backslashes. Strip them so clients see clean text.
#
# Scope / known tradeoff: this is applied only on the ``response_format``
# json-output path (see line ~632 below), not to tool-call arguments or
# regular text content. The cleanup is unconditional within that path,

# ``"C:\\사용자\\file.txt"`` in a response_format=json_object reply) will
