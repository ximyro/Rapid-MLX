class AudioBodyLimitMiddleware:
    """ASGI middleware that bounds the request body of audio-upload
    routes BEFORE Starlette's multipart parser can spool it.

    Why ASGI middleware and not a FastAPI ``Depends``: when the route
    handler signature includes ``file: UploadFile``, Starlette's
    ``MultiPartParser`` runs as part of parameter resolution and reads
    the entire request body off the ``receive`` channel before any
    ``Depends`` callable is invoked. A ``Depends`` that inspects
    ``Content-Length`` therefore fires *after* the body has already been
    drained and spooled to ``SpooledTemporaryFile`` on disk —
    confirmed empirically with an ASGI ``receive`` probe.

    Running at the ASGI layer lets us short-circuit the receive loop
    in TWO complementary ways:

    1. **Honest-``Content-Length`` fast path** — if the advertised
       length exceeds the cap, return 413 immediately. Zero ``receive``
       calls, zero bytes on the server.

    2. **Chunked / no-``Content-Length`` slow path** — wrap ``receive``
       so it tallies streamed body bytes and returns a synthetic
       ``http.disconnect`` once the cap is exceeded. The middleware
       then emits 413. Starlette's multipart parser sees the
       disconnect, stops spooling, and unwinds — the server still
       lands at most ``MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_SIZE + slack`` bytes on disk
       (the threshold at which we trigger the abort), not the
       multi-GB body the attacker tried to send.

    Path scope is intentionally narrow — only
    ``/v1/audio/transcriptions`` uploads a file; ``/v1/audio/speech``
    and ``/v1/audio/voices`` have small JSON bodies bounded by other
    means.
