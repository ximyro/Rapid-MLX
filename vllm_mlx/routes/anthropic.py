    constraint, so a small model can happily defy the pin and emit a
    call to a different tool (the Sergei repro hit qwen3.5-4b on a
    two-tool prompt where the model fired BOTH the pinned tool AND the
    un-pinned one). Pre-fix, the downstream JSON-schema validator
    (F-220) then 400-ed on the un-pinned tool's argument schema —
    leaking validation across a tool the user never asked for and
    silently breaking ``tool_choice``.

    Policy: when the choice pins a specific tool, KEEP only the calls
    to that tool and drop the rest with a warning. This matches the
    user-visible expectation ("you asked for X, here is X") and keeps
    the F-220 validator scoped to the pinned tool. ``"auto"`` /
    ``"required"`` / ``"none"`` / unset shapes pass through unchanged
    — only the explicit named-tool form has a defined "wrong tool"
    case to filter.

    Chat.py's named-function path 422s on the same mismatch (see
    ``routes/chat.py:1665``). The two routes intentionally diverge on
    the "got pinned + extras" case: ``/v1/chat/completions`` mirrors
    OpenAI's strict contract (422), while ``/v1/messages`` mirrors
    Anthropic's more forgiving "deliver the pinned tool's call"
    contract — a 422 on an extra call would surface a confusing error
    to clients that pinned the very tool the response already
    carries. They CONVERGE on the "got zero pinned calls" case, which
    is handled by ``_enforce_named_tool_choice_present`` below (PR
    #763 codex round-1 BLOCKING #1: a filter that emptied the list
    plus a downstream "no tool_calls? end_turn." branch would 200
    with no ``tool_use`` block at all, silently violating the
    forced-tool contract).

    The validator scope refactor in ``_validate_tool_call_params``
    ensures we never validate against the dropped tool's schema even
    if a future change weakens this filter.

    when the client pinned a specific tool: an empty post-filter list

    # emit one for non-extended-thinking models, so any client that

    # below to every place this function constructs
    # ``("thinking", ...)`` pieces: channel-routed (engine
    # OutputRouter), reasoning-parser delta split, and the raw
    # ``<think>`` think_router heuristic. When the gate fires the

    # assistant turn still surfaces the model's output (silent drop
    # is the worse failure mode, #569).

    # (multi-model mode), fall back to the global parser pair in

        Two concerns, in one pass:

        1. **Non-thinking alias demotion.** When ``_reasoning_enabled``
           is False (per-request alias has ``reasoning_parser: null``
           in ``aliases.json``), every ``("thinking", text)`` piece is
           rewritten to ``("text", text)``. The rewrite preserves order
           so downstream ``_emit_content_pieces`` still merges
           consecutive same-type pieces into a single content block.

        2. **No-empty-block parity with non-stream.** The non-stream
           ``openai_to_anthropic`` predicate skips a thinking block when
           ``reasoning_text.strip() == ""``. Mirror that on the
           streaming surface so a model that emits ``<think> </think>``
           or a whitespace-only reasoning channel delta does NOT open a
           thinking ``content_block_start`` + whitespace
           ``thinking_delta`` that Claude Code surfaces as a blank
           thought bubble.

        The whitespace guard is **state-aware**: a whitespace-only
        thinking piece is only dropped when it would OPEN a blank
        thinking block — i.e. no thinking block is currently open in
        the SSE stream (``current_block_type != "thinking"``) AND no
        later piece in this batch carries non-whitespace thinking
        content that would mark the leading whitespace as an
        intra-thinking separator. This preserves the
        ``"first" + "\n\n" + "second"`` shape that the model uses to
        break thinking into paragraphs without leaking the
        ``"   " -> open empty block`` shape (codex r3 MAJOR probe 1,
        refined per codex r4 MAJOR).

        ``current_block_type`` is the block type currently OPEN at the
        downstream emitter (None / "text" / "thinking") — when it's
        "thinking" we ALWAYS keep whitespace because it's an intra-block
        continuation, never a block opener.
