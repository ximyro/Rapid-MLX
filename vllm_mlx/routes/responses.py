"""OpenAI Responses API endpoint — /v1/responses.

Stateless shim that lets Codex CLI (and any other Responses-API client)
talk to rapid-mlx as if it were OpenAI. Translates Responses → Chat,
runs inference through the existing engine, translates back into the
seven SSE events Codex CLI parses (``response.created``,
``response.output_item.added``, ``response.output_text.delta``,
``response.function_call_arguments.delta``, ``response.output_item.done``,
``response.completed``, ``response.failed``).

Statelessness: ``previous_response_id`` returns 400. Codex CLI doesn't
use that field (openai/codex#3841) — it re-sends the full conversation
history every turn in ``input``.
