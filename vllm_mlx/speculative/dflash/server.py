"""DFlash server — dedicated single-user mode that bypasses BatchedEngine.

When ``--enable-dflash`` is set, the CLI launches this server instead of
the standard ``vllm_mlx.server.app``. It hosts a minimal OpenAI-compatible
surface (``/healthz``, ``/v1/models``, ``/v1/chat/completions``) and routes
generation through mlx-vlm's ``stream_generate`` with the loaded DFlash
drafter.

Why a separate server (not a fork of the standard route)?
  - mlx-vlm's ``generate_step`` is a per-request Python generator with its
    own ``prompt_cache`` argument. BatchedEngine merges per-request KV
    caches into a ``BatchKVCache``. Grafting one onto the other would
    invent batched-DFlash that doesn't exist upstream and would risk
    regressing the non-DFlash path under attention layout changes.
  - DFlash today only validates on B=1 anyway (see PoC: 1.83-2.18× on
    Qwen3.5-27B-8bit; no batched-DFlash kernel exists in mlx-vlm 0.5.0).
  - A separate, opt-in server is a clean blast-radius boundary: turning
    on DFlash can never break a request that doesn't use it.

v1 limitations (documented in README + ``rapid-mlx info``):
  - Single-user serial. Concurrent requests queue on an ``asyncio.Lock``.
  - No tool calling, MCP, embeddings, or audio in this server (the
    standard server handles those).
  - No prefix cache (per-request KV cache built fresh each call).

These limitations are deliberate for v1 — the target user is someone
running ``rapid-mlx serve qwen3.5-27b-8bit --enable-dflash`` to get a
~2× speedup on code/long-form completions on a single Apple Silicon box.

    ``is_moe`` flag aliases.json maintains by hand) and is therefore
    only enforced via the CLI entrypoint — callers serving an
    arbitrary ``main_model_repo`` programmatically are responsible for
    not pointing it at a MoE model. Documented in CALLERS.md.
