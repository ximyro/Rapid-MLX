"""Reasoning parser for UI-TARS (ByteDance) GUI-agent VLMs.

UI-TARS emits an unambiguous ``Thought: <chain-of-thought>\n\nAction: ...``
shape per the upstream ``codes/ui_tars/prompt.py`` (COMPUTER_USE_DOUBAO,
MOBILE_USE_DOUBAO). The 1.5 line also occasionally opens with
``Reflection: ... Action_Summary: ...`` as a richer scratchpad — both
preludes are reasoning, not user-facing prose.

This parser splits the prelude into ``reasoning_content`` and leaves the
``Action:`` lines for the matching ``UiTarsToolParser`` to consume.
Symmetric with the tool parser: the action lines are the tool channel,
the ``Thought:`` / ``Reflection:`` line is the reasoning channel.
