"""Reasoning parser for UI-TARS (ByteDance) GUI-agent VLMs.

UI-TARS emits an unambiguous ``Thought: <chain-of-thought>\n\nAction: ...``
shape per the upstream ``codes/ui_tars/prompt.py`` (COMPUTER_USE_DOUBAO,
MOBILE_USE_DOUBAO). The 1.5 line also occasionally opens with
``Reflection: ... Action_Summary: ...`` as a richer scratchpad — both
preludes are reasoning, not user-facing prose.

This parser splits the prelude into ``reasoning_content`` and leaves the
``Action:`` lines for the matching ``UiTarsToolParser`` to consume.
Symmetric with the tool parser: the action lines are the tool channel,
the ``Thought:`` / ``Reflection:`` line is the reasoning channel.

# Anchor at start-of-output so a mid-response mention of "Thought:" inside
# a user-supplied screenshot caption doesn't get misclassified.
#
# Five preamble shapes are recognized (one match per response):
#   1. "Thought: ...\nAction: ..."         (default UI-TARS Computer-Use prompt)
#   2. "Reflection: ...\nAction_Summary: ...\nAction: ..."  (1.5 reflective shape)
#   3. "Action_Summary: ...\nAction: ..."  (1.5 minimal-reflection shape)
#   4. "Thought: ...\n\n<plain-chat answer>" (plain chat lane, blank-line boundary — R6-M1)
#   4b. "Thought: <single-line>$"          (plain chat lane, EOS-only — R6-M1)
#   5. "<think>...</think><plain-chat answer>"  (generic think-tag fallback — R6-M1)
#
# R6-M1 fix (Aki R1, 2026-06-21): pre-fix the regex required ``(?=\s*Action:)``
# so shapes #4/#5 silently failed to match. On the plain chat lane (no
# Computer-Use tool declared, so r5-B's tool-coupled gate skipped the
# action-API sysprompt injection) the model still emitted ``Thought: ...``
# preambles — because the UI-TARS checkpoint is post-trained on the format
# — but the reasoning channel returned ``None``. The decoupling: the
# reasoning emission gate triggers on the parser-detected preamble shape,
# NOT on the presence of any auto-injected sysprompt. The Action: lookahead
# was a coincidence of the C-05 dogfood scenario, not a structural
# requirement.
#
# Boundary semantics:
# - For shape #1/#2/#3 (Action lane): the rest-after-preamble is consumed
#   by the tool parser as ``content``.
# - For shape #4 (plain Thought, blank-line boundary): the boundary is the
#   first ``\n\s*\n`` — bytes before are reasoning, bytes after are content.
# - For shape #4b (plain Thought, EOS only): when the model emitted a
#   single-line ``Thought:`` and nothing else (no follow-up answer), the
#   entire buffer is reasoning. Codex r4 MEDIUM — pre-fix this branch
#   was ``\s*\Z`` with ``re.DOTALL``, which lazy-matched up to EOS even
#   when the body spanned multiple lines of plain prose (e.g.
#   ``"Thought: I should answer directly.\nThe answer is 4."`` was
#   classified as 100 % reasoning, dropping the model's answer). The
#   restricted body ``[^\n]*?`` bans embedded newlines so the EOS branch
#   only fires for genuinely single-line truncated thoughts; multi-line
#   plain prose without a blank-line boundary falls through to "no
#   preamble" and the whole text is routed to content.
# - For shape #5 (think-tag): the boundary is the literal ``</think>``.
#
# Non-greedy bodies prevent a runaway thought trace from swallowing
# legitimate downstream content / action lines.
