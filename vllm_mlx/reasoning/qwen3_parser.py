Reasoning parser for Qwen3 models.

Qwen3 uses <think>...</think> tags for reasoning content and supports
a strict switch via 'enable_thinking=False' in chat template kwargs.

Supports implicit reasoning mode where <think> is injected in the prompt
by AI agents (e.g., OpenCode) and only </think> appears in the output.

# Bare-text "thinking process" prefix patterns.
#
# Qwen3 chat templates inject ``<think>\n`` after the assistant generation
# marker when ``enable_thinking=True`` — putting the model in implicit-think
# mode. The model is supposed to emit its chain-of-thought followed by
# ``</think>`` and then the user-facing answer. In practice the model
# sometimes restates the channel boundary inline as a bare-text prefix
# like ``Here's a thinking process:\n\n1. **Analyze...`` (the same shape
# Gemini / older Anthropic models use). When that happens and the model
# also runs out of ``max_tokens`` before producing ``</think>``, the
# entire output is reasoning preamble but neither tag is in the output
# string — so the default "no end token, no start token" branch routes
# the whole thing into ``content`` and ``reasoning_content`` stays empty.
#
# Scoped narrowly to **unambiguous scratchpad labels** — phrases that
# overwhelmingly signal chain-of-thought, identified by (a) being
# known scratchpad nouns and (b) ending with label punctuation (``:``).
#
# Excluded — common direct-answer phrasings (would clobber valid
# answers if the model said them with ``enable_thinking=False`` or
# without ``enable_thinking`` set):
#   * ``Let me think…`` / ``I need to analyze…`` (codex r1 BLOCKING)
#   * Bare ``Step by step:`` / ``Step-by-step:`` (codex r2 BLOCKING)
#   * Bare ``thinking:`` (``Here's my thinking: …``) — the broader
#     ``thinking(?:\s+process)?`` form generated false positives on
#     direct answers (codex r3 BLOCKING)
#   * Bare ``reasoning:`` / ``reasoning process:`` (``Here's my
#     reasoning: …``) — ``reasoning`` alone is a very common direct-
#     answer opener and many legacy callers default to
#     ``enable_thinking=None``; firing on this label clobbers valid
#     responses on the most common code path (codex r4 BLOCKING).
#     ``thinking process``, ``thought process``, ``chain-of-thought``,
#     and ``scratchpad`` survive because they are scratchpad-shaped
#     in a way ``reasoning`` is not.
#   * Verb-form ``Thinking step by step:`` / ``Thinking out loud:`` /
#     ``Thinking through this:`` / ``Thinking carefully:`` /
#     ``Thinking aloud:`` — these are conversational answer openers
#     ("Thinking carefully: Portland is the safest option") and would
#     misclassify when the caller defaults to ``enable_thinking=None``
#     (codex r5 BLOCKING). The unambiguous scratchpad form is always
#     ``Here's [my/a/the] <noun>:`` — the noun-led shape is what makes
#     it scratchpad-shaped, the verb-led form is too conversational.
#
# Match anchored at ``^\s*`` so a normal answer that merely mentions
# a scratchpad noun mid-response is not reclassified.
