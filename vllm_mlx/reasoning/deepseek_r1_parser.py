    VibeThinker is Qwen2-derived (1.5B base = Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, 3B base
    = Qwen2.5-Coder-3B) and emits a chatty multi-sentence preamble BEFORE
    its ``<think>`` opener — observed in the 2026-06-17 live test:

        "Okay, let me think about this carefully and step by step.\n\n"

    The 80-char preamble (~13 tokens) blows past the parent class's
    64-char ``NO_TAG_CONTENT_THRESHOLD``, so streaming routing flipped
    from reasoning → content mid-preamble; by the time the literal
    ``<think>`` arrived, the reasoning trace was already leaking into
    ``content`` deltas (live-test merge_intervals row).

    A 1024-char (~250-300 token) window gives the model room to produce
    a multi-sentence preamble before ``<think>`` while ``finalize_streaming``
    still issues the reasoning → content correction for genuinely no-tag
    short responses that stay under the new threshold for the entire
    stream.

    Scoped narrowly to the VibeThinker family (codex r2 P2): widening the
    parent class's threshold globally would push every DeepSeek-R1-family
    no-tag answer under 1024 chars into the reasoning channel and delay
    visible ``content`` until completion. This subclass localises the
    larger window to the only model that actually needs it.
