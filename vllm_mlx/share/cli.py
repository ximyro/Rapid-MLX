"""``rapid-mlx share <alias>`` — start a serve + open a public tunnel.

Orchestration shape:

  1. Validate alias (cheap fail-fast before booting the engine).
  2. Pick a free local port + generate a fresh 24-byte bearer key.
  3. Spawn ``rapid-mlx serve`` in a child process pointing at that port.
  4. Wait for /healthz to come back ready, then auth-gate /v1/models.
  5. Open a WebSocket to the rapidserver Worker (defaults to
     ``wss://rapidserver.quicksilverpro.io/up``). The Worker mints a
     Durable Object keyed on our tunnel id; inbound HTTPS requests at
     ``https://rapidserver.quicksilverpro.io/r/<id>/...`` are
     reverse-multiplexed back to us over the same WS frame.
  6. Probe ``<public_url>/v1/models`` to prove the tunnel ↔ serve
     round-trip works, then print the security banner + URL + key.
  7. Block until Ctrl-C, monitoring both the serve subprocess and the
     WS tunnel thread.
  8. On exit, close the WS first (cheap) then terminate serve.

State lives in ``~/.cache/rapid-mlx/share/`` — pid + serve log only.
Key + URL are NOT persisted: each invocation issues a new key
(per user's "new key every share" preference) and a new session.

Architecture pivot (2026-06-03): the prior PR #504 design used frpc +
a control-plane HTTP endpoint + frps relay running on the operator's
M3 Ultra. We replaced that whole stack with a Cloudflare Worker so
prod no longer depends on the operator's personal machine. See
``ws_tunnel.py`` for the wire protocol and ``rapidmlx.com/worker/``
for the Worker code.

    Precedence: ``--chat-frontend`` > ``$RAPID_MLX_CHAT_FRONTEND`` >
    built-in default (``https://rapid-pro.quicksilverpro.io``). An explicit
    empty string at either layer disables the one-click chat link
    entirely — useful when the user is wiring up an OpenAI-compatible
    frontend like OpenWebUI that doesn't implement the splash
    share-key protocol.

    Returns the validated origin (``scheme://host[:port]``) or ``None``
    when disabled. Raises ``ValueError`` on malformed input — the share
    command surfaces that as exit 2 (user error, not crash).

    Validation rules (defense against a hostile env var or copy-pasted
    snippet from somewhere the user shouldn't trust):

    * Scheme must be ``https`` or ``http`` — no ``javascript:``, no
      ``ftp:``, no ``file:``. We're going to embed the user's bearer
      key in the URL fragment so anything that could parse the URL as
      "do something other than open a chat tab" is a foot-gun.
    * **No userinfo.** ``https://chat.rapidmlx.com@evil.com`` parses
      to ``netloc='chat.rapidmlx.com@evil.com'`` — if we echo netloc
      back verbatim the banner advertises a link that visually starts
      with ``chat.rapidmlx.com`` but actually points the bearer key
      at ``evil.com``. Codex round-7 BLOCKING. We reject any URL with
      userinfo and rebuild the origin from ``hostname`` + ``port``
      (never from ``netloc``).
    * Plain ``http://`` is only allowed for loopback hosts. Embedding
      a bearer key in a URL pointed at a non-loopback HTTP origin
      means an attacker on-path between the user and that origin can
      see the key (the fragment is parsed by JS but the *user* still
      types the URL, and some browsers and link-handlers log the
      request URL including the fragment — better safe). Loopback is
      determined via ``ipaddress.is_loopback`` so canonical IPv6
      forms (``::0001``, ``0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1``) are recognised, not
      just the bare ``::1`` literal.
    * No path, query, or fragment — we own the ``/#k=...`` shape and
      need a clean origin to append onto. ``foo.com/bar`` would yield
      a banner link that points at ``foo.com/bar/#k=...`` which the
      receiving splash wouldn't recognise as its own bootstrap path.
