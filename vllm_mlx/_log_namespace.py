Runtime log namespace rebrand: ``vllm_mlx.*`` -> ``rapid_mlx.*``.

The Python package directory is still ``vllm_mlx/`` (renaming would touch
every import in the repo and every external integration), but the product,
PyPI distribution, and CLI are all called ``rapid-mlx``. Without this shim,
``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` returns ``vllm_mlx.<submodule>`` and every
log line a user copies into a bug report or LLM reads as a stale, internal
name.

We use ``logging.setLogRecordFactory`` rather than a logger- or
handler-attached filter for three reasons:

1. **Logger filters don't propagate to children** -- a filter on the
   ``vllm_mlx`` logger would NOT see records emitted by ``vllm_mlx.scheduler``
   etc. (Python docs: "Filters added to a logger are not used by descendant
   loggers.")
2. **Handler filters are fragile** -- uvicorn, pytest's caplog, and any
   library that installs its own handler bypass a filter pinned to the root
   logger's basicConfig StreamHandler.
3. **Factory runs once per record at creation time** -- ``record.name`` is
   already ``vllm_mlx.<sub>`` when the factory runs, so we can rewrite it
   before any handler (stream, file, caplog) sees it. Third-party namespaces
   are left untouched because the prefix check filters them out.

This is install-once, idempotent, and removable in one line (revert the
``setLogRecordFactory`` call). No churn across the 70+ ``getLogger(__name__)``
sites in the codebase.
