"""Streaming + guided generation route contract.

Pins Gap #2 from the v0.6.60 onboarding sweep: ``stream=true`` requests
with ``response_format: json_schema`` must route through
``engine.generate_with_schema`` (constrained), NOT ``engine.stream_chat``
(unconstrained). Pre-fix, the stream branch of
``_create_chat_completion_impl`` ignored ``supports_guided_generation``
entirely and the model would emit unconstrained tokens (e.g. a
``\\`\\`\\`json ... \\`\\`\\`\\`` markdown fence) defeating the user's intent.

Two contract tests:

1. **Success path** — guided streaming is used, fallback engine.stream_chat
   is not called, the synthesized SSE stream carries the constrained text.

2. **Fallback path** — if ``generate_with_schema`` raises, the helper
   falls back to ``engine.stream_chat`` so request liveness is preserved
   (clients in strict-mode use cases should validate themselves; this
   matches the non-streaming fallback semantics).
