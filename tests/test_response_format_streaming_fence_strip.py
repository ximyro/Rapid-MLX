"""H-07: streaming + json_mode must NOT leak ```json ... ``` markdown fence.

The non-streaming chat response builder peels a markdown ``` ```json ```
wrapper via ``extract_json_from_response`` (vllm_mlx/api/utils.py) AFTER
assembling the full text. The streaming path concatenated raw model
tokens WITHOUT the same scrub — joined SSE deltas decoded as
``` ```json\\n{...}\\n``` ``` and ``json.loads`` failed for any SDK
consumer assembling ``delta.content`` into a string.

Marisol (0.8TODO r2 H-07) caught the regression: same prompt + same
model + ``response_format={"type":"json_object"}`` + ``stream=True``
produced fenced output while the non-stream path produced bare JSON.

This test file pins the fence-strip state machine in
``StreamingPostProcessor`` (see ``_apply_json_fence_strip``). Design
rationale (state machine in delta builder, not post-join regex):

  * Fence tokens are split across delta chunks. Tokenizers fragment
    ``\\n``` `` arbitrarily ("``", "`json", "\\n"); a post-emission
    regex would not help because we need to SUPPRESS bytes BEFORE
    they reach the wire.
  * The bare-JSON path (model returns ``{...}`` with no fence at all)
    must pass through unchanged — we can't unconditionally buffer.
  * Non-stream regression: the non-stream
    ``extract_json_from_response`` path must keep peeling the fence
    via its existing logic. We verify it still does.

The tests below exercise the postprocessor directly with mocked
``GenerationOutput`` chunks — the same surface area the live SSE route
goes through (``stream_chat_completion`` -> ``processor.process_chunk``
-> ``_filter_events_for_json_fence``).
