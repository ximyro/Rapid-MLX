"""Regression tests for the global request-body size cap.

Defends against the F-007 DoS pattern (rapid-desktop#273 / #463):
a 10–100 MB JSON body silently ran ~60–90 s of useless prefill on a
27B alias before the client gave up. The cap MUST reject oversized
bodies at the ASGI layer with HTTP 413 *before* FastAPI JSON parsing
runs.

The audio variant has its own multipart-aware cap with a higher
budget — these tests assert the JSON-route cap leaves that path alone.
