Tests for the MLX hardware-compat shim (#404 M5 single-stream).

We can't test on actual M5 from CI, but we can:
1. Verify the shim is installed *before* any module-level
   ``mx.new_thread_local_stream`` capture inside ``mlx_lm.generate``,
   by checking that importing ``vllm_mlx.scheduler`` triggers install().
2. Mock the probe failure and assert the fallback path returns
   ``mx.default_stream(...)``.
3. Verify idempotency — install() can be called multiple times safely.
4. Verify the shim is transparent on hardware that works (this runs on
   the dev's actual hardware in the test-apple-silicon CI job).

We do NOT test that ``import vllm_mlx`` installs the shim — that is the
*wrong* contract. We deliberately keep top-level ``import vllm_mlx``
free of ``mlx.core`` import so the package stays usable for metadata-only
access on systems where ``mlx`` is installed but Metal is unavailable
(``import mlx.core`` SIGABRTs there with an uncatchable NSException).

def test_every_mlx_lm_consumer_installs_shim():

    *at module load time* MUST also call ``_mlx_compat.install()`` before
    the first such import.

    Why ANY ``mlx_lm`` submodule, not just ``mlx_lm.generate``: importing
    e.g. ``mlx_lm.sample_utils`` or ``mlx_lm.models.base`` still triggers
    ``mlx_lm/__init__.py`` execution, which does ``from .generate import
    batch_generate, generate, stream_generate`` and therefore runs
    ``mlx_lm/generate.py:226`` ``generation_stream =
    mx.new_thread_local_stream(mx.default_device())`` at module-import
    time. The #404 single-stream crash on M5 happens on the same code
    path regardless of which submodule the import statement names.

    Why AST-based and not text-based: imports inside top-level ``try /
    except ImportError`` blocks are indented but still execute at module
    load time. ``vllm_mlx/utils/mamba_cache.py`` and ``vllm_mlx/api/
    guided.py`` both use that pattern for optional-dep guards, and a
    line-prefix check misses them. We walk the AST and accept any
    ``Import`` / ``ImportFrom`` whose parent chain stays inside
    module-load-time scopes (``If`` / ``Try`` / ``With`` / ``For`` /
    ``While`` bodies, plus ``ClassDef`` bodies — class statements run
    at definition time), while excluding ``FunctionDef`` /
    ``AsyncFunctionDef`` / ``Lambda`` (deferred to call time).

    Surfaced by community PR #485 (Michael Ledin / @mxl, 2026-05-29):
    ``mllm_batch_generator.py``, ``mllm_scheduler.py``, and
    ``models/deepseek_v4.py`` all had top-level ``mlx_lm.<sub>`` imports
    without the shim; the prior version of this guard (which matched
    only literal ``mlx_lm.generate``) missed all three. Codex round 1
    review against this PR then surfaced the indented-import gap above,
    and DeepSeek pr_validate round 2 added the ``ClassDef``-descent
    requirement (class bodies execute at module load).

    This is a structural audit: a new file that adds a module-load-time
    ``mlx_lm.*`` import without ``_mlx_compat.install()`` first will
    fail here at unit-test time, catching the slip before any M5 user
    does.
