"""Regression coverage for r6-B R6-C3 streaming Action: hold-back.

Bug fixed: the streaming UI-TARS tool parser used to leak raw
``Action: <verb>`` bytes into ``delta.content`` BEFORE the structured
``delta.tool_calls`` flush. Two leak vectors:

1. ``has_pending_tool_call("Action: type")`` returned ``False`` because
   the strict ``_ACTION_LINE`` regex requires ``(``. The streaming
   postprocessor's fast-path then short-circuited the delta as plain
   ``content`` — leaking the bare ``Action: <verb>`` bytes.
2. ``extract_tool_calls_streaming`` returned ``{"content": delta_text}``
   when ``"Action:" not in current_text``, even when the trailing bytes
   were a STRICT PREFIX of ``Action:`` (e.g. delta ended with ``"\\nAc"``).
   The next delta resolved the token but those candidate-opener bytes
   had already left the wire.

R6-C3 fix: parser-level hold-back state machine.

* ``has_pending_tool_call`` now returns True for bare ``Action:``
  (no verb / parens yet) AND for trailing strict-prefix of ``Action:``
  at the buffer tail.
* ``extract_tool_calls_streaming`` clips off the trailing partial-opener
  candidate before flushing the safe prefix as content.

Repro: dogfood-087 R2-6 (Aki r2.md) — chat completions streaming with
UI-TARS + computer tool + click prompt; streamed chunks contained
``delta.content="Action: type"`` raw text BEFORE the ``delta.tool_calls``
event fired with the structured action.
