"""r8-C: streaming reasoning split + think-leak regressions.

Drives the full streaming postprocessor (``StreamingPostProcessor``)
with the prompts identified in the r8 Mira + Sven evidence and asserts
the SSE-level routing matches the documented non-stream behaviour.

* **R8-M6** — UI-TARS-native ``Thought: I should answer.\n\nAnswer: 4``
  used to stream the entire prompt (including the answer ``"4"``) on
  ``delta.reasoning``. The non-stream path correctly splits at the
  blank-line boundary per ``a16d8c8`` (shape #4) — the streaming
  state machine in ``vllm_mlx/reasoning/ui_tars_parser.py`` did not
  mirror that exit predicate. Mirror also added for ``</think>``
  (shape #5) and ``Answer:`` (defensive UI-TARS native form).

* **R8-M2** — With ``enable_thinking=False`` and ``tool_choice="auto"``
  Qwen3-thinking sometimes ignores the off-flag and still emits an
  explicit ``<think>...</think>`` wrapper. The pre-fix bypass routed
  the literal wrapper bytes to ``delta.content`` BEFORE the tool-call
  chunk. The postprocessor now detects the explicit wrapper (including
  its split-SSE leading edge) and re-enters the reasoning lane so the
  gate splits BEFORE content emit.

Tests deliberately exercise the postprocessor end-to-end (the parser
in isolation is covered separately in ``test_ui_tars_parser.py`` /
``test_reasoning_parsers.py``) so the assertions reflect the
on-wire SSE shape, not the parser's intermediate ``DeltaMessage``.
