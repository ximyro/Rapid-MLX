"""Regression tests for the chat-route tool-tag leak bug.

Bug: when the tool parser successfully extracted tool_calls from output that
contained an unclosed `<tool_call>` block (model omitted the closing tag), it
returned `content=None` (i.e. fully stripped). routes/chat.py then fell back
to the RAW output for the reasoning parser via `cleaned_text or output.text`,
and the reasoning parser strips `<think>` but not `<tool_call>` — so the
opening tag + JSON survived all the way to user-facing `content`.

Detected by `rapid-mlx agents hermes --test` (no_tool_leak + stress_no_leak)
even on a strong 27B model, ruling out model weakness. Fix: when tool_calls
were extracted, trust the tool parser's cleaned_text and only run the
reasoning parser to recover reasoning_text from the raw output.
