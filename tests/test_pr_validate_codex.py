"""Tests for the codex review step's pure helpers.

The ``codex exec`` call itself is integration-level (requires the
codex CLI to be installed and logged in, hits the network) and lives
in ``scripts/pr_validate/steps/codex_review.py``. We test only the
helpers that have isolated logic plus the JSONL parser:

- ``_truncate_diff_at_file_boundary`` — file-boundary aware diff cap
- ``_is_safe_listing_path`` — path-traversal filter for the dir-listing
  enhancement that feeds ``gh api``
- ``_parse_codex_jsonl`` — codex exec stdout parser (agent_message
  concatenation + ``turn.completed`` usage extraction)

The diff-cap and path-filter tests were carried over from the prior
DeepSeek step verbatim: regex missing git's quoted-filename form,
``startswith("..")`` over-filter, and the ``.``-current-dir leak are
all real bugs surfaced by PR review on the original implementation.
