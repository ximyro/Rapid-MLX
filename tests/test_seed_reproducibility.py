"""H-11 regression guard — per-request OpenAI ``seed`` reproducibility.

Pre-fix (Tomek r3 repro): five calls to ``/v1/chat/completions`` with
``{"temperature": 0.7, "seed": 42}`` produced five different outputs.
The ``seed`` field was not declared on ``ChatCompletionRequest`` so
Pydantic silently dropped it; the wire-claim was false.

The fix plumbs ``seed`` through five layers — the same surfaces F-011 /
#355 covered for the other sampling params:

  1. ``ChatCompletionRequest`` / ``CompletionRequest`` (api/models.py) —
     ``seed: int | None`` declared without a range bound (matches
     OpenAI's documented unbounded-int surface; codex round-6) and
     guarded by a ``mode="before"`` validator that rejects bool /
     non-int. Backend uint32 narrowing happens in
     ``make_seeded_sampler`` via a deterministic ``& 0xFFFFFFFF`` fold.
  2. ``build_extended_sampling_kwargs`` (service/helpers.py) — forwards
     the request's ``seed`` value through to ``chat_kwargs``.
  3. ``SamplingParams`` (request.py) — carries ``seed: int | None``.
  4. ``BatchedEngine.generate`` / ``stream_generate`` (engine/batched.py)
     — pops ``seed`` from kwargs into ``_sp_kwargs``.
  5. ``Scheduler._get_request_sampler`` (scheduler.py) — routes seeded
     requests around the shared sampler cache and builds a fresh
     ``make_seeded_sampler`` closure that threads an explicit
     ``mx.random.key`` per step.

The sampler primitive (``_seeded_sampler.make_seeded_sampler``) uses
``mx.random.split`` + ``mx.random.categorical(..., key=...)`` so two
seeded requests can interleave their sampler calls (concurrent batch
rows in ``GenerationBatch._step``) without cross-contaminating each
other's PRNG sequences — a property the global ``mx.random.state``
cannot provide.

    """Codex round-7 + round-8 BLOCKING regression guard.

    The round-2 fix OR'd argmax into the combined mask unconditionally
    to prevent all-``-inf`` rows from reaching ``mx.random.categorical``.
    Codex r7 caught a hole in that contract: when ``top_k`` is layered
    with a tighter ``top_p`` / ``min_p`` that excluded argmax from the
    top-k set, the unconditional rescue would re-inject argmax —
    changing ``top_k`` from "sample only from the top K" to "sample
    from top K or argmax".

    The round-7 fix gated the rescue via
    ``mx.where(any_kept, mask, argmax_keep)``. Codex round-8 then
    flagged that the original round-7 test (asserting same-seed
    determinism) was vacuous — it would pass under the OLD
    unconditional ``mask | argmax_keep`` AND under a hypothetical
    flipped-``mx.where`` because both arms produce reproducible
    sequences. The test below directly exercises the helper with
    hand-built masks that pin the actual contract:

      * Non-empty mask that EXCLUDES argmax — must be returned
        UNCHANGED. The old unconditional ``|`` would have set the
        argmax position to True; the conditional rescue must not.
      * All-False mask — must fall back to a single-True at argmax.
        The round-2 contract (no degenerate ``-inf`` rows) still
        holds.
      * Batched two-row case (one row non-empty, one row empty) —
        per-row gating must keep them independent.

    This test fails under the OLD unconditional ``mask | argmax_keep``
    behaviour because the argmax position would be flipped from False
    to True. It also fails under a flipped ``mx.where(any_kept,
    argmax_keep, mask)`` because the non-empty mask would be replaced
    by a single-True argmax instead of returned unchanged.
