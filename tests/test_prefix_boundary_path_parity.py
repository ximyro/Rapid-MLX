"""Path-parity regression for the prefix_boundary wiring (#427).

PR #435 added per-message boundary snapshots so hybrid (Mamba+Transformer)
models can reuse cache across multi-turn conversations. The fix wired
``_compute_prefix_boundary`` into ``BatchedEngine.stream_chat()`` (the
streaming path) but missed ``chat()`` and ``generate()`` — the entry
points for non-streaming clients. pydantic_ai, smolagents and langchain
all default to ``stream:false`` so they hit those entry points and the
fix was a no-op for them, leaving the very bug fishloa reported
(opencode, multi-turn agentic, Qwen3.6 hybrid) unfixed.

This test enforces the contract that BOTH paths must compute and forward
``prefix_boundary`` for multi-message conversations. It's structured as
a path-parity assertion: anything the streaming path does for the
boundary handoff, the non-streaming path must do too.
