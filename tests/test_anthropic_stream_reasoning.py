"""Regression test for #185 — Anthropic stream returns 0 chunks for reasoning models.

Bug: when a `reasoning_parser` was active for a reasoning model (qwen3
family etc.), `_stream_anthropic_messages` ran the parser's already-split
`delta_msg.content` through `StreamingThinkRouter`. The router was
initialized with `start_in_thinking=True` (chat templates that contain
`<think>` + `add_generation_prompt` flip the flag) and waited for a
`</think>` close tag in the stream — but the reasoning_parser had
already stripped those, so nothing ever closed and everything stayed
buffered as `thinking_delta`. Net effect: `text_stream` returned 0
chunks for qwen3 since v0.6.4.

Fix (PR #208): when `reasoning_parser` is active, bypass `think_router`
and emit `delta_msg.reasoning` and `delta_msg.content` directly as
their own block types. The parser already owns the split.
