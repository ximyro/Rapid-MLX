"""Regression tests for F-012: RST mid-SSE under storm leaves zombie
requests in the scheduler that consume KV cache until Metal OOM
(upstream cause of F-010 dense path and F-030 tool path).

Root cause: ``AsyncEngineCore.add_request`` awaits
``loop.run_in_executor(..., scheduler.add_request, request)`` to push
the request to the MLX worker thread. ``run_in_executor`` does NOT
propagate ``CancelledError`` into the executor task — if the awaiter is
cancelled mid-flight, the executor keeps running and ``scheduler.add_request``
may complete AFTER the route layer has already unwound. The result is a
request alive in the scheduler with no consumer; ``stream_outputs.finally``
never runs (it was never entered), so the request runs to its full
``max_tokens`` budget pinning KV slots. Under a 30-RST storm this
produces 0-30 orphans per storm, leading to unbounded Metal growth.

The fix has two layers:

* ``engine_core.add_request`` shields the executor await so cancellation
  always lands AFTER the scheduler has the request, then deferred-aborts
  + ``_cleanup_request`` on the cancellation path.

* ``batched.stream_generate`` wraps ``add_request → stream_outputs`` in
  a ``try/finally`` that defensively aborts the request when it
  unwinds, covering the narrow race between ``add_request`` returning
  and ``stream_outputs.try`` actually starting.

These tests pin both behaviours so a future refactor cannot silently
restore the leak. They drive the ``BatchedEngine`` / ``AsyncEngineCore``
abort path directly via mocks — no actual MLX inference required.
