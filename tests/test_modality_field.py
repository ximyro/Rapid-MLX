"""Contract pins for the ``AliasProfile.modality`` field — added on
the ``feat/diffusion-gemma`` skeleton PR. These tests guarantee:

  1. Legacy aliases (no ``modality`` key) keep loading and default to
     ``"text"``. This protects every existing entry in ``aliases.json``
     from a silent routing flip when the field landed.
  2. The accepted modality set is exactly the documented Literal.
     Drift between the Literal and the loader's allow-list has shipped
     silently in this repo before (see ``suffix_decoding_tier`` pre-#283).
  3. Non-text modalities cannot carry AR-only capability gates
     (``supports_spec_decode`` / ``supports_dflash``). Fail loud at
     load instead of misroute at request time.
  4. The diffusion-lane skeleton imports cleanly. The module is
     intentionally not wired into any active code path yet — but it
     must not break ``vllm_mlx`` import.
