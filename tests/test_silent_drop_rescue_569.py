"""Regression tests for issue #569.

gemma-4-26b-4bit multi-turn tool calls silently drop content + tool_calls
when reasoning doesn't terminate. The model gets stuck inside
``<|channel>thought\n…`` and runs out of its token budget before
emitting any ``<|tool_call>`` or ``<|channel>content`` marker. The
engine's token-level ``OutputRouter`` correctly routes every token to
``reasoning``, but the route then emits an OpenAI-compat message with
``content=null`` and ``tool_calls=null`` while ``reasoning_content``
carries the entire stuck thought. Agentic clients (Cline, Cursor,
Codex CLI) read ``content`` and ``tool_calls`` only, see an empty
message, and either retry into the same trap or stall.

The fix: ``_rescue_silent_drop_from_reasoning`` runs at the route
layer AFTER tool-call parsing and AFTER the reasoning/content split.
When ``final_content`` is empty/None AND no ``tool_calls`` fired AND
``reasoning_text`` is non-empty, surface ``reasoning_text`` as
``content``. ``reasoning_content`` stays populated unchanged
(duplication between fields is the lesser evil vs. silent drop).
