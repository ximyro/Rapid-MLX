"""Regression test for harmony reasoning_content silently dropping on the
non-streaming + no-tools path.

Bug surfaced 2026-05-22 in a fresh-PyPI v0.6.65 onboarding smoke test
against ``mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8``: a reasoning prompt with
no tools came back with ``reasoning_content=""`` while the full
chain-of-thought leaked into ``content``. Tool calls and streaming both
worked — only ``non-stream + no-tools + harmony`` broke.

Root cause: the engine calls ``clean_output_text`` on the raw harmony
output before constructing ``GenerationOutput``. ``_clean_gpt_oss_output``
extracts the final-channel content and strips all channel markers, so by
the time the route's ``_finalize_content_and_reasoning`` runs the
reasoning parser, the ``<|channel|>analysis<|message|>…<|end|>`` block
no longer exists in ``cleaned_text``. ``HarmonyReasoningParser`` finds
nothing and returns ``(None, None)``. PR #436 added a guard that
preserved ``content`` from being clobbered to None, but did not rescue
``reasoning_content`` — that's what this test pins.

Fix: ``GenerationOutput`` now carries ``raw_text`` (the pre-clean output).
Routes pass it to the helper, which retries the reasoning parser on
``raw_text`` whenever the first parse against ``cleaned_text`` yielded
no reasoning. Non-harmony parsers (``<think>``-based) are unaffected
because their first parse succeeds on cleaned_text — they never enter
the retry branch.
