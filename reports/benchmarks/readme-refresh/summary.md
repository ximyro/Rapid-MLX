# README benchmark refresh — B=4 concurrent throughput

Generated: 2026-06-06
M3 Ultra 256 GB · macOS 25.3.0
Engines: rapid-mlx v0.6.80 · mlx-lm 0.31.3 · Ollama 0.24.0

Workload: 4 concurrent streaming requests, ~32 input tokens, 256 max output
tokens each, temperature 0.7, top_p 0.95.
Thinking-off requested via `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=False`,
which rapid-mlx / mlx-lm / mlx-vlm honour; Ollama 0.24 ignores it for
Qwen3 and keeps streaming `delta.reasoning` chunks — those chunks decode
at the same model rate as content tokens so we count them, which means
the Qwen3 Ollama numbers reflect CoT-on throughput in practice.
Metric: aggregate tok/s = sum(output_tokens across 4 streams) / wall_clock
(authoritative token count comes from the streaming `usage` chunk, not
from counting SSE frames).
Each engine reported as the median of 3 measured rounds after 1 discarded
warmup. Engines were swapped sequentially (8 s cooldown between) so Metal
contention never crossed engine boundaries.

Aggregate tok/s = sum across 4 concurrent streams ÷ wall-clock seconds
(includes first-token latency). The JSON artifacts also carry
`median_per_stream_tps`, which is each request's **decode-only** rate
(`output_tokens / (e2e − ttft)`) — that is typically higher than
`aggregate / concurrency` because it excludes the prefill phase.

### Audit trail of result files

This directory keeps every JSON the bench harness emitted during the
refresh — including the two exploratory rows that errored:

- `results-20260606-152047.json` and `results-20260606-152654.json`
  carry the failed `qwen3.5-27b` Ollama warmup against the Unsloth
  Qwen3.6-27B GGUF (HTTP 500 "unable to load model"; Ollama paths
  redacted to `<redacted-home>`). These are superseded by
  `results-20260606-153334.json`, which is the working `qwen3:32b`
  re-run cited above.

Failed rows are retained so a reader can reconstruct the methodology
trail without having to rerun the same dead ends. They are NOT counted
in the README table.

### Engine isolation caveat

`OllamaEngine.stop()` only unloads its own row's tag — the Ollama 0.24
daemon keeps previously loaded blobs warm in memory between rows. The
8-second engine-swap cooldown drops Metal pressure but does **not**
evict residency. In practice this means an Ollama row's measurement may
benefit (warm metadata) or suffer (Metal cache contention) from prior
rows. To control for this, run `ollama ps` between rows or restart
`ollama serve` between models when chasing ±2 % deltas. The numbers in
this table did not exhibit drift round-to-round (CoV < 1 %), so we
left the run untouched, but the limitation is recorded for any
follow-up A/B work.

### Notes

1. The qwen3.5-27b Ollama row is benched against `qwen3:32b`
   (dense Qwen3 32B, the closest tag Ollama 0.24 can actually load).
   The first attempt mapped to `hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`
   but every load raised HTTP 500 "unable to load model" — Qwen3.6
   dense hasn't landed in llama.cpp yet — so we switched and recorded
   the working comparator. The row above and the README cite
   `qwen3:32b`.
2. mlx-lm 0.31.3 can't run Gemma 4 (its Gemma 4 loader lives in mlx-vlm).
3. Architecture caveats — Ollama can't load Qwen3.5/3.6 DeltaNet or
   Gemma 4 natively; the comparison tag is the closest available arch:
   - qwen3.5-4b/9b → qwen3:4b/8b (Qwen3 base, not 3.5; same model family)
   - qwen3.5-27b → qwen3:32b (closest dense Qwen3 that Ollama 0.24 will load; see note 1)
   - qwen3.6-35b / qwen3.5-35b → qwen3:30b-a3b (closest MoE A3B)
   - gemma-4-12b → gemma3:12b (Gemma 3, prior generation)
4. gpt-oss-20b is the only direct apples-to-apples row: same model
   weights both sides. The 2.29x is unmodified by arch gap.
