"""Validate one or more community benchmark submission files.

Run modes:

    # Validate every JSON file under submissions/
    python community-benchmarks/scripts/validate.py

    # Validate specific files (used by the GHA on PR diff)
    python community-benchmarks/scripts/validate.py path/to/sub.json ...

Layered checks, in order:

1. **JSON parse** — file must decode.
2. **Schema** — must match ``community-benchmarks/schema.json``
   (draft 2020-12, ``additionalProperties: false`` everywhere). The
   const fields on ``config.rounds`` etc. are enforced here.
3. **Whitelist** — ``model.alias`` must exist in
   ``vllm_mlx/aliases.json`` and ``model.hf_path`` must match the
   value stored there. We re-check after the CLI's own whitelist
   guard because the JSON file in a PR is the authoritative artifact;
   anything else is just history.
4. **Sanity** — decode_tps > 0, ttft_ms < 30 s, peak_ram_mb <= chip's
   RAM, chip non-empty, etc. These don't catch every fraud, but they
   cut the noise floor so a real outlier still gets reviewer attention.

Exit code is the number of failed files (capped at 125 so it fits in a
shell exit status). 0 = all clean. The GHA fails the job on non-zero.

Designed to run with stdlib only when ``jsonschema`` isn't installed —
in that case schema validation is skipped with a clear warning. The
GHA installs ``jsonschema`` explicitly, so CI always runs the full
check; local invocations stay friction-free.
