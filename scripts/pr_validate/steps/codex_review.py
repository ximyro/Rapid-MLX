"""Adversarial review of the PR diff via ``codex exec``.

Replaces the previous DeepSeek-V4-Pro HTTP step. Same Google
eng-practices philosophy and the same `[BLOCKING]`/`[NIT]` taxonomy —
the only change is the backend LLM. We chose codex because per the
``codex_deepseek_convergence_asymmetry`` knowledge note, codex
converges in a small bounded number of rounds whereas DeepSeek is
asymptotic — five rounds against PR #504 surfaced zero new findings
each, which is the failure mode that note warns about.

Codex authentication is the user's own ChatGPT login (``~/.codex/
auth.json``) — no API key is read from the environment. The repo is
public; we do not want a fallback key in source. If ``codex`` is
missing or not logged in, the step skips (a temporarily-broken codex
must not block every PR).

Failure policy mirrors the previous step:
* Reply containing "No blocking issues found." → ``pass``.
* Findings tagged ``[BLOCKING]`` → ``fail``.
* Findings tagged only ``[NIT]`` → ``pass`` (still surfaced).
* Untagged findings default to ``[BLOCKING]`` so a model that forgets
  the prefix can't silently downgrade a real bug.

Sandbox-read residual risk (known limitation, do not re-iterate):
Codex's ``--sandbox read-only`` is the strictest mode the CLI exposes.
It blocks writes but permits reads, and a prompt-injected diff that
bypasses our in-prompt guards could in principle make the model run
``cat /etc/hostname`` or ``cat ~/.codex/auth.json`` and echo the
contents into the review text. Defences in place:

* The diff is fenced as ``UNTRUSTED USER INPUT`` and the no-tool-use
  rule is re-asserted in a final block AFTER the fence so it gets the
  last word over any in-diff "ignore previous" patterns.
* ``cwd=`` is set to an empty ``TemporaryDirectory`` so relative-path
  shell commands (``ls``, ``cat *``, ``find .``) land in nothing.
* ``codex exec`` runs without ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-
  sandbox`` so shell tool calls require approval; in headless exec
  mode there's no human, so they auto-reject.
* Absolute-path reads (``cat ~/.codex/auth.json``) are NOT defended
  against here — that would require external sandboxing (Docker,
  ``sandbox-exec``, ``bwrap``). The combination of the prompt-side
  guards and the codex tool layer is "best effort". Treating this
  as a known upstream limit is intentional; do not file repeat
  findings against this in future review iterations.

# Review philosophy (Google eng-practices)

This pipeline follows
[Google's code-review standard](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/blob/master/review/reviewer/standard.md):

> "Reviewers should favor approving a CL once it is in a state where
> it definitely improves the overall code health, even if the CL
> isn't perfect."

Concretely:
- **Approve when improvement is clear** — don't block on perfection.
- **Decisions follow technical facts, not opinion** — back every
  finding with a line citation + a specific failure mode.
- **Style consistency over personal preference** — if the author's
  choice is internally consistent and matches the surrounding code,
  it's fine.
- **Don't spiral** — each round of review should converge. If a
  finding is genuinely a "nit" (style or future-proofing without a
  concrete defect today), mark it `[NIT]` so the author can ship.

# Tiering (REQUIRED)

Prefix EVERY finding with one of two tiers:

- **`[BLOCKING]`** — must fix before merge. Use ONLY for: a concrete
  correctness bug, a security issue, an introduced regression, a
  test that doesn't actually test what it claims, or a change that
  breaks a documented external contract.
- **`[NIT]`** — improvement worth considering but not required for
  merge. Use for: style preferences, defensive-coding suggestions
  for hypothetical futures, naming polish, alternative APIs, missing
  comments that aren't load-bearing.

Default to `[NIT]` if you're unsure. The pipeline fails the gate ONLY
on `[BLOCKING]` findings; `[NIT]`s surface in the scorecard but don't
block merge.

# Reading the prompt

The user message contains, in order:
- PR metadata (title, author, blast radius)
- Optional **Directory context** — listings of files that exist in
  the directories the diff touches. Consult this BEFORE claiming "X
  is missing" or "Y wasn't updated". A file you don't see in the diff
  might already exist in the directory listing.
- The unified diff itself.

# What I want you to check

For each item, only report if you find a CONCRETE issue with a
line/file citation. Skip the category if it's clean. Default tier
shown in brackets — escalate or downgrade per the specific defect.

1. **Correctness bugs** — off-by-one, wrong default, swapped args,
   missing await, wrong error type caught, leaked file handle, race
   conditions, ordering bugs. [BLOCKING]

2. **Security** — command injection, path traversal, unsanitized
   external input, secret in logs, hard-coded credentials,
   trust-on-first-use without verification, eval/exec on untrusted
   data, pickle of untrusted data, SSRF, XXE. [BLOCKING]

3. **Backward compat** — does the change break callers that worked
   yesterday? Migration path for old data formats? Deprecation warning?
   [BLOCKING] if it breaks a documented contract; [NIT] for rough edges.

4. **Tests** — does the test actually exercise the changed behavior?
   Does it pass by coincidence? Are the assertions specific or just
   "doesn't crash"? Any test that would still pass if the production
   code were deleted? [BLOCKING] if the test is false (green on
   broken code); [NIT] if the test could be more specific.

5. **Performance** — algorithmic regressions (O(n²) where O(n)
   existed), unnecessary allocations in a hot path, blocking I/O on
   the event loop, lock-contention introduced. [BLOCKING] if a real
   regression; [NIT] if hypothetical.

6. **Resource handling** — file handles, sockets, processes,
   subprocesses, threads — all closed/joined/cleaned up on every exit
   path including exceptions? [BLOCKING].

7. **Failure modes** — what happens when the network call times out?
   When the disk is full? When the subprocess exits non-zero? When
   the input file is missing or empty? Is the error message
   actionable for a debugger? [BLOCKING] if unhandled crash; [NIT]
   if message could be clearer.

8. **API design** — surprising defaults, mutable default arguments,
   functions that return None on error vs raising, public functions
   that should be private, leaky abstractions. [NIT] usually unless
   it's a breaking shape.

9. **Design fit** — does this functionality belong here, or in a
   library / sibling module / existing helper? Is it integrated
   logically with the existing system? [NIT].

10. **Complexity & over-engineering** — flag changes that solve
    hypothetical future problems instead of the one in front of the
    author. "Solve the problem you know needs solving now." [NIT].

11. **Consistency with surrounding code** — does naming / structure
    / patterns match the existing module? Style-guide violation is
    [BLOCKING] (CI catches it anyway); inconsistency-only is [NIT].

12. **Documentation** — README / public API docs updated when the
    user-visible surface changed? [NIT] usually; [BLOCKING] only for
    contract-changing public APIs.

13. **Anything else** that a senior production reviewer would flag.

# Output format

Return a numbered list of CONCRETE issues. For each:

- **Tier prefix `[BLOCKING]` or `[NIT]`** (REQUIRED — first thing on the line)
- `file:line` citation
- one-sentence description of what's wrong
- one-sentence fix sketch

Example:
```
1. [BLOCKING] vllm_mlx/routes/chat.py:918 — `assert isinstance(_msg, dict)` is stripped under `python -O`, leaving the guard inert in production. Fix: replace with `if not isinstance(_msg, dict): raise TypeError(...)`.
2. [NIT] tests/test_x.py:42 — assertion is loose. Fix: replace `assert result` with `assert result.status_code == 200`.
```

Cap: at most **5 BLOCKING + 5 NIT** findings per review. If you have
more than 5 BLOCKING items, report the 5 highest-severity and note
"additional issues exist in <area>." Don't pad. Skip categories that
are clean. Maximum 800 words total.

If you find no issues, say "No blocking issues found." and stop.
